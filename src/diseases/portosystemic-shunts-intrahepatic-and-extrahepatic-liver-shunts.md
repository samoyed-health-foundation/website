## Description

Portosystemic Shunts are vascular anomalies that cause portal blood to bypass the liver. These can be either congenital or acquired. The congenital shunts are usually a single vessel that can be either Extrahepatic (EHPPS) outside the liver or Intrahepatic (IHPPS) inside the liver. Acquired shunts are usually multiple and are secondary to an underlying hepatic disease process and the development of portal hypertension.

Extrahepatic shunts (EHPPS) are commonly found in small breeds of dogs. They are considered a developmental anomaly. Intrahepatic shunts (IHPPS) are often found in large breeds of dogs. Intrahapetic shunts are caused by a failure of the vessel that regulates blood flow from the placenta to vital organs like lungs & heart during fetal development to close. This would usually close within a few days of birth. (1).

## Signs and Symptoms

Dogs with Congenital Shunts tend to present at a young age though asymptomatic dogs as old as 13 have been seen (2). There is no gender predisposition. Clinical signs may increase after eating.

Signs of Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) – Ataxia, behavioural changes, aggression, pacing, circling, head pressing, blindness, seizures, coma. Failure to thrive or gain weight. Often small in stature - runt of litter. Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomiting, intermittent anorexia, diarrhoea, pica. Often have poor anesthesia tolerance. Ammonium biurate crystals or Stones.

It is thought that this is a semi-lethal gene and likely causes fetal death so not all affected puppies are even seen. (2)

## Causes

Congenital portosystemic shunts have been reported in 110 of 201 (55%) breeds of dogs. It is more common in purebred dogs than cross bred dogs (3) (4) and has been demonstrated to be genetic in many different breeds of dogs (3) (4) (5) (6) though predisposed breeds can vary from country to country (5).

## Diagnostic Tests

Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Bile Acid Test. Common advanced imaging diagnostic tests include Abdominal Ultrasound, Nuclear Scintigraphy, MRI & Computed tomography (CT).

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** _Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol._

**Medical Management**

Medical management is used for dogs that cannot have surgery or when surgery is declined and also to stabilize dogs prior to surgery. Medical management is titrated for each individual depending on severity of symptoms therefore it is best to work with a veterinary specialist. Medical management can control the signs of HE but will not treat the underlying hepatic atrophy. For dogs with intrahepatic shunts GI protectants are recommended for life usually Omeprazole .(7)

**Surgical management**

Considered the best long term solution for shunts, it redirects the shunting blood to the liver reversing hepatic atrophy and may resolve clinical signs.

Extrahepatic shunts - suture ligation, cellophane banding or ameroid constriction.

Intrahapetic shunts have been considered more challenging to fix overall often with high mortality using the above surgical methods. There is now a minimally invasive method – Percutaneous Transjugular Coil Embolization. The mortality rate with this procedure is less than 5% (7).

Medical vs. Surgical management is a complex subject there have been very few studies published. (8) (9) One other study has been presented in abstract form at the ACVIM Forum in 2012 by Cornell University. This involves the largest number of dogs so far but it is yet to be published. (10)
