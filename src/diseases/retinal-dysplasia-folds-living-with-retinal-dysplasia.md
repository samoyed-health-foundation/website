- **Age at onset:** 6 months

- **Sex:** Female

- **How the diagnosis was made?:** The Samoyed was taken in for her first CERF testing and extensive retinal folds were discovered. The ophthalmologist did not believe her folds would flatten or improve with maturity. Also, he suspected she had some blinds spots because of the number of folds seen.

- **Management:** This Samoyed was re-examined at 1 year by the same ophthalmologist and juvenile cataracts were found and also the folds were still as intense. The Samoyed has yearly eye examinations by an ophthalmologist to monitor her condition. The Samoyed does not have any restriction or any medications. She is a very physically active Samoyed even though it does appear she has a few blind spots. She was spayed at one year of age because of her eye conditions.

The above Samoyed, now at 7.5 yrs of age, still has retinal folds that are seen when examined by the ophthalmologist.
