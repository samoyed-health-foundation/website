# Description

Albinism is a genetic disorder characterized by a complete or partial
lack of melanin, or pigment, in eyes, skin and hair. This lack of
pigmentation can cause several associated conditions which have been
studied extensively in human beings and in dogs.

An albino dog with blue eyes is called a Cornaz Albino. A Samoyed with
blue eyes isn't necessarily an albino or partial albino if it has skin
pigmentation.

## Signs and Symptoms

An albino Samoyed will be recognized initially because of lack of nose,
eye rim and lip pigment and then because the eyes look _light_. Closer
examination will usually show a blue or green eye. These can range from
very pale to quite intense colour. A _pink_ eye is the usual albino
trait in some mammals.

The lack of melanin in the eye can cause several sight problems. Albinos
may have poor vision, "evidenced by difficulty catching pieces of
biscuit" (Pearson 1929). The lack of pigment in the iris causes the
retina to be exposed, resulting in sensitivity to bright light and
glare. Strabismus ('lazy eye') and Nystagmus (rapid eye movements) have
also been recorded in humans and albino Dobermans.

In humans, an extremely rare form of albinism, Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, can lead to problems with bruising, bleeding, susceptibility
to diseases that affect the bowels and lungs, and other physical
problems that can decrease the lifespan. There is also a suggestion
through various web sites that canine albinos are more 'delicate'
generally than normally pigmented dogs, and more prone to bacterial
infections and skin rashes.

## Causes

There are different levels of albinism, not categorized in dogs, but
they are all thought to be genetic. In other mammals, mutations causing
albinism have been found in two genes. One is the gene for tyrosinase,
an enzyme that helps convert the amino acid tyrosine into melanin
(presumably the "C" coat color gene). The other is for the "P" gene
that helps produce the structure within the cell (melanosome) that
contains melanin. The genes/mutations for albinism in some other breeds have
been identified, but not in Samoyeds.

## Risk Factors

## Diagnostic Tests

\[There are no genetic tests yet for albinism in dogs. Diagnosis is
typically by observation of the eyes and skin (nose, lips, eye rims,
footpads, and skin beneath the thick white fur).]

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Albinism cannot be treated _per se_, but the conditions associated with
it can be helped, see Management Tips.

## Management

Melanin in the skin is a protection from sun radiation, so the absence
makes the skin highly vulnerable to sunburn. Because of this, in human
beings, albinos have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly
squamous and basal cell carcinoma. There is no evidence of increased
risk for malignant melanoma. In albino Dobermans, easy skin tearing and
rashes were also noted. Skin can be protected from sunburn with 'people
quality' suntan cream on exposed areas. The eye rims can cause a problem
as it is inadvisable to use non canine preparations so close to the
eyes.

Dogs with eye problems as described in Signs and Symptoms will usually
confine themselves to areas where they are least affected and it is
unwise to force an albino dog to go into bright areas. Samoyeds having
the usual ebullient personality will probably ignore this rule!

Samoyed coats were not made to be kept in the sun for long periods and
will dry out and generally look frizzled. Albino coats having a total
lack of pigment, e.g. no biscuit or cream shading, are more at risk. Do
not keep your dog outside in the sun.

Fascinating reading about colour breeding after the first World War.
Pearson was the first to use the term "Cornaz Albino," in memory of
Charles Auguste Edouard Cornaz -- a European ophthalmologist who studied
congenital eye abnormalities in the 1800s. Pearson described a Cornaz
Albino as a dog with a very pale coat color and "albinotic eyes," in
contrast to a Dondo Albino, a pure white dog with the same "albinotic
eyes." The term is now commonly used to describe a blue-eyed albino
dog.

No support group for owners of albinos were found. Individual sites
exist for Deaf and Blind dogs.
