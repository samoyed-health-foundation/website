Thank you to Joy Ritter for putting together this article for SCARF.

In normal circulation, the ventricle on the right side of the heart
pumps blood to the lungs where it picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood
then returns to the left side of the heart and is pumped to the rest of
the body.

As the blood leaves the right ventricle it flows through the pulmonic
valve into the pulmonary artery which goes to the lungs. With pulmonic
stenosis (PS), there is a narrowing (stenosis) or obstruction in this
path. This is usually due to a malformation of the pulmonic valve
("pulmonic valve dysplasia"), but the abnormality may be just above or
below the valve as well.

The heart must work harder to pump the blood past the obstruction. This
extra workload causes the right ventricle to thicken. The extent to
which a dog may be affected depends on the degree of narrowing of the
valve area. With severe stenosis the increased workload on the heart may
lead to right-side congestive heart failure.

of the heart showing the pulmonic stenosis.

## Signs and Symptoms

1. Heart murmur, lower left quadrant of heart
2. In symptomatic cases, exercise intolerance, lethargy, lack of
   appetite
3. Pale gums, fainting spells
4. In severe cases, right side congestive heart failure

## Causes

1. Congenital (present at birth due to developmental problems or
   genetics). Inheritable in some breeds as a polygenic threshold trait
   (complex inheritance controlled by a number of genes). It appears
   to be inheritable in Samoyeds, although this has yet to be confirmed
   in formal scientific studies. It is one of the most common heart
   defects seen in Samoyeds.

## Risk Factors

Parent(s) and/or sibling(s) with disease.

## Diagnostic Tests

1. Manual Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) by board
   certified cardiologist, followed by
2. Color Doppler echocardiography (a type of ultrasound) to
   definitively diagnose the disease
3. Chest Xrays
4. Once a diagnosis has been made, a cardiac catherization can be done
   to measure the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the
   pulmonary artery, to determine the severity of the obstruction.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

1. Mild forms, no treatment necessary.
2. Moderate to severe forms, relief of symptoms as necessary
   (diuretics, blood pressure medications for heart failure relief and
   slow heart function), under the direction of a veterinary
   cardiologist, if possible.
3. Surgery (for example, balloon valvuloplasty) is possible to repair
   the valve in some cases.
4. Prognosis for mild forms, good. However, should NOT be bred, as it
   is a congenital condition.

## Management

From an owner's perspective:

The mild form of PS is self limiting. Dogs should be spayed/neutered to
prevent accidental pregnancy. Nutritional advice would be to keep the
dog at optimum weight. Overweight dogs put a strain on the heart
(already stressed). Underweight due to nutritional challenges also puts
stress on the heart. Treat symptoms as they arise and have periodic
(annual) checkups with a cardio vet to access progression of the
disease. Allow the dog to self limit his exercise. No FORCED exercise
(pulling, sledding, jogging, etc.).
