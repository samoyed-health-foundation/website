Reviewers have evaluated the references and suggested links for the disorder/syndromes/diseases by the following guidelines:

![1 bone](/img/1-bone.gif) Conclusions supported by anecdotal evidence, an individual breeder's opinion or experience, and non-affiliated (personal) websites with credible information backed by affirmation of website owners. This might include warnings or caution about a product or procedure based upon personal experience. All sources of information should have current contact information of the person or organization supplying the information. The source of information and supporting evidence is contained in the article.

![2 bones](/img/2-bones.gif) Information based on material published in general dog magazines (i.e. Dog Fancy, Dog World, etc.), breed publications (i.e. Samoyed Quarterly, AKC Gazette, etc.), breed websites or published books about dogs or specific breeds â€“ having a general consensus among reputable breeders and/or veterinarians, but lacking supporting scientific research. Interviews with researchers and unpublished research data might also be considered from reputable investigators and organizations with permission and clearly listed as not peer-reviewed. Sources have current contact information and, for accuracy and to avoid any accusations of plagiarism, the source material is credited with footnotes, citations, or listed within the text.

![3 bones](/img/3-bones.gif) Information is based on preliminary peer-reviewed findings but still in a theoretical phase of understanding (citations must be listed). This includes results of initial published studies or experimental therapies and might consist of findings in other species that have a reasonable expectation of application to dogs in general and/or Samoyeds in particular. Sources include: scientific, medical or veterinary journals or their official websites (American Journal of Veterinary Research, Science, Nature, JAMA etc.), medical or veterinary organizations or their websites (i.e. American Veterinary Medical Association, OFA etc.), university publications or websites (esp. veterinary schools), and charitable medical research organizations (SPCA, American Cancer Society, etc.).

![4 bones](/img/4-bones.gif) Information and conclusions are based on an established body of peer-reviewed research (multiple citations and replicated research) in science/veterinary journals and information contained in contemporary veterinary textbooks. Sources are analogous to the above three-paw rating, but the information presented reflects a general consensus of the scientific and/or veterinary community. All references are clearly credited with footnotes or reference citations.
