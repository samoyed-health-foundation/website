Two Dogs:

**Dog 1:** Mild Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia diagnosed at under 1
year. No symptoms except mild exercise intolerance and enlarged heart
on xray. Dog is currently 4+ years old.

**Dog 2:** No murmur present. At 1 year, it was noted that dog didn't
'like' to jog any distances and couldn't keep up with other dog when
jogging together. Dog frequently 'paced' at eighteen months. No other
symptoms were noted until 22 months of age. Dog developed a wet
cough. Upon examination, right side heart failure was diagnosed. After
extensive diagnostic testing by a cardiologists, TVD was
diagnosed---severe. Dog was put on diuretics to relieve heart failure
symptoms. During the next 6 months, dog lost weight extensively,
exhibited grey gums, several recurrent bouts of heart failure, lack of
appetite, lethargy. Dog dropped dead suddenly after waking in the am at
28 months of age. Time from onset of symptoms to death: 6 months, with
aggressive veterinary treatment.

diseases known in Samoyeds. However, this also seems to be the most
debilitating type of heart disease in Samoyeds. Most cardiologists
asked do not see this condition in the Samoyed.
