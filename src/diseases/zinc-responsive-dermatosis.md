## Summary

Zinc Responsive Dermatosis is a skin disorder that responds to treatment
with zinc. It is one of the manifestations of zinc deficiency. The
deficiency can be dietary, or in some Arctic breeds, Samoyeds being one
of them, it can be an inherited disorder of zinc absorption.

## Signs and Symptoms

Initial symptoms are thick scaly/crusty patches and alopecia (hair loss)
around the eyes and muzzle. This can also be seen on the ears, hocks,
under the pads and around the reproductive organs in both dogs and
bitches. Thick crusting occurs on pressure points, e.g. elbows. Hair may
be dull and harsh and secondary skin infections can occur. Many dogs
will scratch or chew at affected areas due to itching. Symptoms may
occur at any age, but typically are first seen in young adult dogs.

Extended zinc deficiency can cause other problems, including lack of
appetite and ensuing weight loss, slow wound healing, keratitis
(inflammation of the cornea) and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the
conjunctiva -- the tissue that covers the inner eyelid and the white of
the eyeball). Lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) can occur in very
young dogs.

## Causes

There can be several reasons for zinc deficiency:

**Dietary**:

- Feeding incomplete feeds with insufficient zinc
- Over feeding other mineral supplements, especially calcium, iron and
  copper
- Feeding excess phytates, a substance found in some cereal-based
  diets that interferes with zinc absorption in the intestine

**Hereditary**:

- Malabsorption, commonly thought to be a recessive, inherited
  disorder in Arctic breeds

## Risk Factors

- Related dogs with disorder
- Arctic breed (Samoyed, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky)

## Diagnostic Tests

Skin problems are generally hard to diagnose but this one has definite
changes that can be easily recognized. Diagnosis can be made by
microscopic analysis of a punch biopsy of the skin. This biopsy can be
done under local anesthetic. The diagnosis is confirmed by the dog's
response to zinc supplementation.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

If the cause of the zinc deficiency is dietary, an improvement in diet
and short term zinc supplementation can usually bring improvement in a
month or two.

If the cause is hereditary, the zinc supplementation will usually
relieve symptoms, but may have to continue lifelong. Zinc can be
administered by mouth but care must be taken not to overdose an affected
dog as zinc poisoning can occur. The correct dose must be determined for
each dog. Larger doses can cause vomiting. If large doses are needed,
they can be divided and given, with food, several times a day. In some
cases zinc is given intravenously. Once a correct dosage is determined
with the aid of your Veterinary Surgeon, it will probably have to be
maintained for the life of the animal.

Symptoms will recur if the supplementation is not maintained. Even as
little as one missed dose can cause recurrence. Symptoms may
occasionally flare up whilst supplementation is being administered. If
this happens, they are usually of a short term duration, 2 -- 3 weeks,
and generally resolve spontaneously as long as the maintenance dose is
still given.

Antiseborrheic shampoo can be used for relief of affected areas, but
care must be taken when using around the eyes. Topical relief such as
Aloe Vera gel for immediate relief can be used, although sparingly.

## Management

The gene(s) responsible for poor absorption appear to be recessive, but
there are as yet no genetic markers in evidence in any of the affected
breeds. Spaying females with the disorder has been reported to allow
some owners to decrease, or cease zinc supplementation.
