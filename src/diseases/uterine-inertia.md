## Summary

Uterine Inertia is the failure of contractions during whelping. Normally
the bitch strains and muscles contract pushing puppies into the birth
canal and then expelling them.

Uterine Inertia can fall into two categories. "**Primary Inertia**"
occurs in heavily pregnant bitches near their whelping date. The bitch
fails to have contractions, but the cervix dilates and the placentas can
detach from the uterine wall.

'**Inertia,**' or 'secondary inertia,' is when the bitch stops
contractions part way through a whelping, and is one of the most
frequent causes of Dystocia (abnormal or difficult birth). It can be the
result of uterine fatigue from a puppy blocking the birth canal which
the bitch has failed to expel.

## Signs and Symptoms

**Primary Inertia** is a difficult condition to detect it you do not
know to watch for it. Often you will only notice that the bitch is
uncomfortable. This is when having good records of when the bitch has
been mated are necessary. If you have had hormone tests for ovulation,
this also helps in determining if she is overdue. The main physical
sign is when dark green liquid (placental fluid) appears and the bitch
is not having contractions. She may also be in pain. More advanced cases
show pale mucus membranes and shock.

**Inertia** happens after a whelping has started. The rule of thumb is
no more than an hour between puppies, however this has been found to be
incorrect in practice by many breeders with several hours being
experienced by some, especially if the bitch goes to sleep! This is when
you need to know if there are more puppies to get out.

## Causes

**Primary Inertia** has a couple of causes. The main one is a lack of
the hormone which starts the contraction process. A second one is the
size of the litter; a bitch carrying a huge litter can be so extended
that the muscles are already stretched to the limit and there is no room
for contractions. **Inertia** also has more than one cause. A
mis-presented puppy can cause a bitch to contract with the result that
the bitch is too tired to continue. A big litter can leave the bitch
exhausted and she may need help to continue.

## Risk Factors

- Small, one to two pup, litter size (leading to insufficient hormonal
  stimulation to initiate labor)
- Very large litter size (uterus "overstretched')
- Overweight dam
- Poor muscle tone in dam due to age or other factors
- Prior history of uterine inertia

## Diagnostic Tests

A thorough physical exam should be given by the vet. For **primary
inertia** he will be able to tell if the cervix is dilated and act
accordingly.

For **inertia** during whelping, the vet should be able to feel if there
is a puppy blocking the birth canal. An x-ray may be used to see if
there are more puppies awaiting birth. Fetal monitoring of the unborn
puppies heart rates can assist in determining if they are under
excessive stress.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

In **primary inertia**, a caesarean section as soon as possible is the
only way to ensure any puppies survive. The puppies will drown if it is
performed too late. If a caesarean is not performed in time, the puppies
will die and the bitch will likely die from the resulting infection.

For **inertia** after whelping has started, Oxytocin and Calcium
injections can be tried to restart contractions if the bitch is showing
no other physical signs, although when to use these is somewhat
controversial (see links). If there is bleeding, a caesarean is
required. If there is a puppy blocking the birth canal, the vet may be
able to manually reposition it and deliver it normally, but the rest of
the litter could be at risk if normal contractions do not start again.
More often than not, a Caesarean has to be performed.

## Management

The owner should consult with their veterinarian prior to breeding a
female who has had **primary uterine inertia**, so the owner fully
understands the risk factors involved in a re-breeding of that female.
Likewise, the owner should consult with their veterinarian about the
risk factors for more than 2 C-sections on a bitch, due to resultant
scarring on the uterine horns.

But "A bitch that has had surgical inseminations is not more prone to
needing a caesarean section nor having whelping difficulties^1^" so
there should be no more reason to have **inertia** after AI than for any
other bitch.
