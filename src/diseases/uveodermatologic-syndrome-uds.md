Uveodermatological Syndrome (UDS) is an immune-mediated canine disease
characterized by inflammation of the eye, depigmentation of skin and
whitening of hair. Morbidity is related primarily to the eye
inflammation, which can result in secondary ophthalmological disorders
that lead to blindness. Treatment involves both topical and systemic
immunosuppression.

Uveodermatological Syndrome is similar to the human Vogt-Koyanagi-Haradi
Syndrome (VKH), was first described in 1977 [1]. Human VKH is
characterized by uveitis (inflammation of the eye), poliosis (whitening
of hair), vitiligo (depigmentation of skin) and a variety of
neurological symptoms. Unlike VKH, however, UDS does not usually
present with neurological symptoms. Because of the similarity of the
two entities, UDS is sometimes referred to as VKH-like Syndrome or
simply VKH. Although generally considered to be more common in Northern
breeds, such as Akitas, Siberians and Samoyeds, there have been reports
of the disease in a wide range of breeds, including the Dachshund [2]
and Brazilian Fila dog [3].

## Signs and Symptoms

UDS often presents with bilateral panuveitis, which is generally
characterized by red and cloudy eyes, with tearing and squinting, as
well as varying degrees of localized vitiligo (nose, lips, eye rims and,
less commonly, footpads and anus). Generalized vitiligo has been
reported in two cases [2]. The eye inflammation can cause secondary
complications, such as retinal detachment, cataracts and glaucoma.
Blindness can result from these complications. The syndrome is most
often diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist and requires life long
medical therapy.

## Causes

UDS (and VKH) is thought to be caused by the inappropriate production of
antibodies directed against melanocytes (pigment-producing cells),
although viral infection cannot be ruled out as a cause of the disease
[4]. A recent report describes the association of UDS in American
Akitas with an increased frequency of the DQA1\*00201 allele, suggesting
a genetic component to the disease [5].

## Risk Factors

Most reported cases of UDS involve Akitas (\~80%) suggesting a
predisposition in this breed. The age range reported is from 6 months
to 6 years, with a slightly increased incidence in males [2].

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosis can generally be made on the basis of a microscopic eye
examination; a skin biopsy, usually from an affected area such as the
nose, can also be done, although it is often not necessary to make the
diagnosis.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Morbidity in the case of UDS results from the eye involvement, which can
lead to blindness if left untreated. Treatment consists of
immunosuppression using a combination of systemic and topical
anti-inflammatory medications [2]. Dosages and scheduling varies,
with the goal being to start off using a high dose during the induction
phase, and gradually tapering off to a regimen that keeps the disease in
remission while limiting the potential side effects of long term
treatment.
