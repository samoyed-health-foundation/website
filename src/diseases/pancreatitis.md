The pancreas has two primary functions: an endocrine function
(production of insulin for the regulation of blood sugar) and a
digestive function (secretion of digestive enzymes, primarily for the
digestion and absorption of fats). Pancreatitis refers to an
inflammation of the pancreas. This can be acute or chronic.

## Signs and Symptoms

The primary symptoms are loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and
abdominal pain. These lead to a hunched posture of the dog to help
alleviate the pain, lack of appetite, dehydration, and abdominal
swelling. The diarrhea is caused by undigested fats in the stool which
cause a greasy yellow appearance to the stool. There may be fever. In
more severe cases, there can be heart arrhythmias (irregular heart
beat), sepsis (infection spreading through the blood), respiratory
distress, and a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) which disrupts the normal clotting mechanism resulting in multiple
sites of bleeding in the body. The inflamed pancreas, in very severe
cases, may leak digestive enzymes and result in injury to near-by organs
through partial digestion of them.

## Causes

In most cases the cause is not known (idiopathic)

## Risk Factors

There are a number of possible contributing factors to pancreatitis:

- Certain medications (potassium bromide, some cancer medications,
  sulfa-containing antibiotics)
- Infection
- Certain metabolic disorders: hyperlipidemia (high amount of fat in
  the blood), hypercalcemia (high amount of calcium in the blood),
  hypothyroidism, and hyperadrenocorticism.
- Pancreatic tumor
- Trauma, including abdominal surgery
- Obesity and overweight
- High fat diet
- Middle age
- Genetics: Certain breeds (Schnauzers, Yorkshire Terriers). One study
  found that sled dogs ( Laikis and Malamutes but not Samoyeds were
  listed specifically) were more prone. (2)

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosis is suspected because of the clinical findings. Specific tests
for pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) show elevated levels. Liver
enzyme tests may be elevated as well. Abdominal ultrasound may be
useful. A recent grant study sponsored by SCARF found that a new test,
pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (SPEC cPL) may be useful (4, 5) and
this is becoming the gold standard test.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

**Acute Pancreatitis:** Acute pancreatitis can be life-threatening.
Early recognition and treatment can improve chances of recovery. The
initial mainstay of treatment is to correct dehydration and electrolyte
imbalances, and to allow the pancreas to rest by not feeding anything by
mouth for 24 to 48 hours. Hydration and nutrition are provided
intravenously or subcutaneously (under the skin) during this time. Then
small, bland, low fat, high fiber feedings are begun. Depending on the
severity of the condition and whether or not it becomes chronic, it may
be necessary to continue this diet indefinitely. Underlying causes
(medications, infections) should be treated accordingly. Rarely, a
pancreatic abscess may develop requiring abdominal surgery.

Plasma transfusions may be helpful by providing certain proteins that
inhibit pancreatic enzyme activity. These can be added to the
intravenous fluids used for hydration.

Prognosis is unpredictable. Mild cases may have full recovery and a low
fat diet is all that is needed to prevent recurrence or complications.

Recent studies (3) have found that early enteral (by mouth rather than
by vein) nutrition allows for better health of the intestines and thus a
more rapid recovery. Pain relievers are used as appropriate.

The Royal Veterinary College in London has completed a study on the
[Nutritional Management of Acute Pancreatitis in Dogs and
Cats. ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24690138/)![three

**Chronic pancreatitis:** Some animals develop chronic pancreatitis
which can lead to diabetes or pancreatic insufficiency. In this latter
instance, food is passed undigested. Dogs with this condition have a
ravenous appetite, diarrhea, and weight loss even though they are
eating. Treatment for pancreatic insufficiency is life long and
expensive. Digestive enzymes can be replaced through a product processed
from the pancreas of hogs and cattle.
