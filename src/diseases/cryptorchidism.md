## Summary

At birth, the testicles of a male puppy are still within its abdomen. As
the animal develops, the testicles slowly "descend" into the scrotum.
The scrotum provides a cooler environment for sperm development, which
does not occur correctly at the higher temperatures found within the
mammalian body.

In cryptorchidism, one or both testicles are "hidden." A unilateral
cryptorchid dog is a male with only one testicle descended into the
scrotum; the other testicle is retained in the inguinal canal or
abdominal region. A bilateral cryptorchid has no visible testicles;
both are retained. Unilateral cryptorchids are often called monorchids,
mistakenly. A monorchid literally has only one testicle.

## Signs and Symptoms

The sign of cryptorchidism is a lack of visible/palpable testicles in
the scrotum of an intact male dog.

## Causes

This is generally considered to be a hereditary problem in dogs. In
breeds that have been studied, it appears to be polygenetic (caused by
more than one gene) and recessive (parents may not exhibit the problem,
but can pass it on). The genetics have not been studied specifically in
Samoyeds.

## Risk Factors

- Related dogs with cryptorchidism
- Sires and dams who have produced cryptorchids
- Dams from litters where a male sibling had cryptorchidism

## Diagnostic Tests

Testicles are usually visible to the naked eye, but Samoyeds are often
discreet, shielding them with vast amounts of hair.

Testicles can also be palpated (examined by touch).

In young puppies, the testicles are softer and may be difficult to
palpate. However, they should be descended and palpable by ten weeks.
I know of a puppy who was not entire until he was 5 months old, but this
is an extreme. If the testicles have not descended by the age of 6
months, the path by which they descend is normally closed off.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Hormone injections have been reported to bring down a testicle, but this
has not been proven in well-controlled research\*. The general
consensus is to neuter (castrate) the dog to prevent cancerous
development of the retained testicle. The risk of testicular cancer has
been found to be ten times higher in a retained testicle than in a
descended testicle. When operating, the veterinarian must literally
hunt for the testicle which may be located anywhere from the area around
the kidney in the abdomen to the muscle near the groin.

\* _Note from the AKC secretary: "If it was found that a dog had a
testicle lowered through a chemical treatment, the dog would be
disqualified, with all awards received after the treatment rescinded,and
the owner would be subject to disciplinary action."_

## Management

Be warned. Cryptorchid dogs have been known to sire puppies. Don't think
that because a dog has only one testicle, that it doesn't function.
There is much anecdotal evidence from breeders and pet owners alike that
supports this!

Cryptorchids should not be bred, because the problem is believed to be
hereditary. Careful consideration should also be given to continued
breeding of parents of a cryptorchid, who do carry the defective
gene(s), or breeding of siblings of a cryptorchid, who may carry the
defective gene(s).

A cryptorchid will often have no problems initially with his situation,
showing no indications of being in pain or discomfort. However, research
has shown that retained testicles often become cancerous. Some also
feel that there is an increased risk of testicular torsion, which is
very painful. In some breeds dogs have lived very long lives without
being castrated but these seem to be the exception rather than the rule.

## Support Groups

I can find no support group. This problem has one basic solution which
is a permanent 'cure'. Neutered dogs have their own set of problems,
e.g. obesity, and I can find no support group for Neuters either.
