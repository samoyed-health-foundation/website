Perianal fistulas are tunnel-like lesions in the skin surrounding the
anal area of dogs, usually in dogs between the ages of 5-7 years of age.
The lesions can become more severe ultimately surrounding the entire
anus, and secondary infections may be present. German Shepherds are most
commonly affected along with Irish Setters, however this condition can
occur in any breed of dog. Perianal fistulas may cause severe pain and
discomfort and, if not controlled, may be responsible for a dramatic
reduction in quality of life. Even when treated, they may recur -- it
is typically a chronic disease which is managed, not cured.

## Signs and Symptoms

- Tenesmus -- feeling of incomplete defecation (i.e. straining)
- Dyschezia -- painful or difficult defecation
- Licking of the anal area
- Mucopurulent anal discharge with an odor (Mucus & Pus)
- Visible ulcerating lesions around the anus

## Causes

The exact cause remains unclear. Many breeds affected with Perianal
Fistulas have broad sloping tail heads, which may lead to a
predisposition. There has also been a reported link between colitis and
Perianal Fistulas in German Shepherds.

## Risk Factors

- Breeds whose tail is often carried low between the hip bones,
  covering the anus, is thought to be a predisposing factor.
- There may be a genetic component.

## Diagnostic Tests

- A complete physical examination which includes a digital rectal
  examination is usually performed if one suspects their dog has
  Perianal Fistulas.
- Cell or tissue samples from the anal sacs or fistula may be
  collected for microscopic examination (aspiration cytology or
  histopathology) or for bacterial culture and sensitivity.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

- In the past, the treatment used was to amputate the dog's tail.
  However, the course of treatment most commonly used now is
  immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine or prednisone.
  Azathioprine is another immunosuppressant that may be prescribed if
  the prednisone or cyclosporine is unsuccessful.
- The most common drug used, which gives the greatest improvement, is
  cyclosporine. The downside of this drug is the cost. However,
  there is one possible way to decrease the cost by 35%-70% and that
  is by combining ketoconazole with the cyclosporine (ketoconazole,
  slows the metabolism of cyclosporine allowing the dose to be
  reduced). -- The downside of the combination is that it adds the
  potential side effects of ketoconazole.
- For small fistulas or preventative maintenance, can be treated with
  topical immunosuppressive ointments.
- If medication is not effective, surgery may be performed to excise
  the lesions. If the anal glands are involved, anal sacculectomy may
  be recommended.
- Switching the affected dog to a novel protein diet is also part of
  the treatment.
