# Summary

Thank you to Helen Newman for putting together this article for SCARF.

Aggression in dogs is a normal behavior when displayed in the correct
context.  "It is best defined within a given context as an appropriate
or inappropriate threat or challenge that is ultimately resolved by
combat or deference. Most aggressive dogs are clinically behaviorally
abnormal, but the abnormality is usually progressive and is influenced
by the social environment."  (Overall, 1997).  When the behavior of the
dog is causing problems between the dog and the owner, with other dogs,
or other people you must realize there is a problem of aggression.
Aggression can be divided into a multiple of categories, ranging from 8
to 13, and a dog may fit a multitude of the categories.

## Signs and Symptoms

_Remember to look at these in the context of the situation_.
_And that there may be other subtle signs of reactivity._

**Vocal:** excessive uncontrolled barking (increased agitation),
growling, snarls, lip lifting (usually this is silent), and/or snapping
and biting.

**Physical signals:**  posture of body --standing rigid, hair up, ears
back, walking stiff legged, tail wagging and staring.  Please note that
a wagging tail only means a dog's willingness to interact!

Guarding of territory, food, possessions, humans, etc.

Grabs people's hands, clothing, legs with teeth

## Causes

Abnormal aggressive traits may be a caused by a combination  of
genetics, environment, the breed and medical causes.

_Medical causes_

Brain chemistry

Hypothyroidism

Encephalitis (bacterial or viral) Distemper

Hypoglycemia

Hydrocephalus in brachycephalics

\---Epilepsy

\---Brain tumors

Head trauma

Behavioral Seizures

## Diagnostic Tests

Medical tests should be done to rule out a medical reason for the
aggressive behavior. The dog, owner and any individuals that are daily
involved with the dog should be evaluated by a trained animal
behaviorist or clinician.  How the dog and humans interact normally must
be evaluated by a trained professional.

Other areas that should be evaluated to help with the diagnosis is age
of onset of problem, how long has it been occurring, any changes in
daily patterns, can you predict when the aggression will occur, and how
does the dog respond to any modifications you the owner does.

## Treatment Guidelines

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Once the aggression has been accurately diagnosed, the client should
avoid circumstances that provoke the aggression so the dog does not
learn from the inappropriate behavior.

The clinician will design a behavior modification plan that fits the dog
and the household.

This may include:

* neutering/spaying
* behavior modifications (dog and human):  relaxation,  gradual change, rewards, reinforce proper behavior
* modifying the environment:  crates, fencing, number of other animals in the household, incentives
* Use of head collars, harnesses, appropriate toys, leashes when inside
* Medications may be prescribed
* Follow up assessment with the clinician to decide next step of modification

## Management

Any behavior or environmental modification that one does to get the
situation manageable will be a LIFE LONG commitment.  There will be
times of set backs but following through and staying with the program
designed for you and your dog is necessary.

If a set back occurs though, one should consider discussing with the
clinician for advise and to reevaluate any changes that may have
occurred in the household (a move, change in routine for dog and human,
less time for the dog, etc.)

If the recommended program does seem to be working, one should follow up
with the clinician to discuss the situation.

The dog and the owner must be reeducated and learn the appropriate
response to situations.  It takes time and committment for any
modification program to work.
