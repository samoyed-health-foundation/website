My Samoyed had just finished his championship when he was diagnosed with
Sebaceous Adenitis (SA), a heartbreaking and dreadful disease. He was
only a year old and the Dermatologist said he had a severe case.

I was shocked to discover that Samoyeds ranked behind Poodles and Akitas
in the incidence of SA and may rank higher as it is often misdiagnosed.

We decided to treat with a cyclosporine (Atopica) and with weekly oil
baths of propylene glycol oil followed by Sebalyt shampoo. This type of
oil must remain on the skin for 8 hours, so the recommendation was to do
it at night, crate my Samoyed, and bathe him in the morning. The oil is
expensive and can only be found in pharmacies that compound medicine,
the big chains don't carry it. The oil rinses out easily with tepid
water. I have tried other oils, but don't like them nearly as well nor
do I think they do as good a job on the skin.

The Dermatologist was not sure how much hair would regrow, but thought
we would have a good idea in about 18 months.

After 24 months, there wasn't any significant hair regrowth, so he was
taken off the cyclosporine. The oil baths continued and will continue
for the rest of his life.

With SA, it is important to realize that each dog's case is different.
Each dog's case presents differently, therefore, without a skin punch
biopsy, misdiagnoses may occur. SA also waxes and wanes, and what works
for one dog may not work for another.

SA is presumed to be inherited, but no one is sure what causes it to
become active. It normally rears its ugly head when a dog is older, but
that was not the case with my dog. At one point, he was also refusing
most foods and dropped half of his body weight.

To be honest, I did consider putting him to sleep. If your dog has been
newly diagnosed, I recommend taking a deep breath and not making any
hasty decisions. It is still the same dog who loves you unconditionally
and deserves the same in return.

My Samoyed is now 4 years old and is doing well, but had had a few
setbacks. His treatment currently consist of the weekly oil baths, a
fish based diet, fish oil pills twice daily and twice month acupuncture
treatment which I believe have helped immensely. He also continues to
visit the Dermatologist quarterly.

It is possible to live with a dog with SA. You will shed an ocean of
tears, your Samoyed will no longer be beautiful on the outside and
people may make cruel, unthinking remarks upon seeing him. On the other
hand, you and your dog share a special bond. You will never regret the
extra care, time and effort, and yes money spent on his care.

Remember, you are not alone and others will reach out to help you if
asked.

February, 2009 update - The most recent addition to his treatment
regimen is that one to two days after his bath, I am applying two
pipettes of Douxo Seborrhea Spot-On. We are now using Douxo shampoo.
If this combination works, there is a chance we may be able to stop the
oil treatments. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and will keep you
posted.
