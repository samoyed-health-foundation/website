In Cushing's Disease, also known as hyperadrenocorticism, there is an
excess of cortisol or related corticosteroids in the body. Cortisol
and other corticosteroid hormones are produced by the cortex, or outer
portion, of the adrenal glands. Cortisol is released by the adrenals
in response to various types of "stress" (e.g., food intake, exercise,
pain, fear). It has numerous functions in the body, including affecting
the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates and fat, and reducing
inflammation.

In a normal dog, the pituitary gland "senses" the level of cortisol in
the body. If more is needed, it releases adrenocorticotropic hormone,
or ACTH. This hormone then signals the adrenal glands to release more
cortisol. Cushing's is caused by a defect somewhere in this process.

## Signs and Symptoms

Cushing's Disease is most commonly found in older dogs and many of the
symptoms may be confused with the normal aging process. Some of the
symptoms are increased appetite, increased drinking and urination,
urinary incontinence in females, and pets waking up in the middle of the
night to ask to go outside. Other symptoms include panting/shortness of
breath, high blood pressure, skin lumps, patterned hair loss without
itching, hair that doesn't grow back after grooming, persistent or
recurring skin infections, muscle weakness and extreme lethargy.
_Excess cortisol relaxes the ligaments of the abdomen and causes liver
enlargement leading to the symptom_ _of a_ _potbelly._

In addition to these symptoms, Cushing's Disease may also be suspected
due to abnormal findings during routine bloodwork/urinalysis. These
findings might include higher than normal levels of the liver enzymes
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), abnormal
white cell differential count, or increased urinary cortisol:creatinine
ratio.

## Causes

Cushing's disease can be triggered by tumors of the adrenal or pituitary
glands. Adrenal tumors can overproduce cortisol. Pituitary tumors can
overproduce ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), which then signals the
adrenal gland to make and release too much cortisol. About 85% of the
cases of Cushing's disease in dogs are believed to be caused by
pituitary tumors.

Cushing's disease can also be caused by a dog receiving too much
**corticosteroid** for the treatment of another illness. This is
"iatrogenic" -- inadvertently caused by medical treatment. Some of the
drugs that can cause iatrogenic Cushing's disease are prednisone,
prednisolone, dexamethasone, depomedrol, and betamethasone.

## Diagnostic Tests

If Cushing's disease is suspected due to symptoms and results of routine
blood/urine analysis, the veterinarian will run additional blood tests
which can confirm the presence of Cushing's and help to determine the
cause. Two of the most common tests are described below.

**Dexamethasone Suppression Test** - Dexamethasone is a synthetic
corticosteroid. In a normal dog, a low dose of dexamethasone will
signal the pituitary to stop releasing ACTH (adrenocorticotropic
hormone), the message that tells the adrenals to release cortisol. The
blood cortisol level will then decrease. If a pituitary tumor is
present, the pituitary will continue to release ACTH after dexamethasone
is given, and the cortisol level will stay the same. The test is run by
taking a baseline blood sample, giving a tiny intravenous dose of
dexamethasone, then taking additional blood samples at 4 and 8 hours.
This test can often distinguish between Cushing's caused by adrenal vs
pituitary tumors.

**ACTH Stimulation Test** - ACTH normally stimulates the adrenal glands
to release cortisol. In a normal dog, a dose of ACTH will cause a
normal increase in the level of cortisol in the blood. In Cushing's
disease caused by tumors, the adrenal glands have large amounts of
stored cortisol and a dose of ACTH will cause a larger than normal
increase in cortisol blood levels. In iatrogenic Cushing's, the adrenals
produce/store little cortisol because it is being supplied to the body
by a corticosteroid drug. The dog will have a lower than normal
cortisol response to ACTH. After overnight fasting, the test is run by
taking a baseline blood sample, giving a dose of ACTH (intramuscular or
intravenous), and taking an additional blood sample one to two hours
later.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Many adrenal gland tumors can be surgically removed, although surgery in
this area (near the kidney and aorta) is considered major and usually
requires a specialist. Imaging studies (x-rays, ultrasound, and/or CT)
are used prior to surgery to determine the size of the tumor. Drug
therapy with cortisol is usually needed post-surgery until the other
adrenal gland, which has probably atrophied, recovers its ability to
produce it. If surgery isn't possible, drugs, as described for
treatment of pituitary tumors, may also be used.

Surgery on the pituitary, located at the base of the brain, is very
risky in dogs, requires a neurosurgeon, and is rarely performed.
Pituitary Cushing's is treated with drugs that either destroy part of
the adrenal gland or suppress cortisol production/release directly (at
the adrenal) or indirectly (at the pituitary).

**Lysodren** (also called mitotane or o,p'-DDD) destroys adrenal tissue
that produces cortisol. Monitoring blood tests are required to make
sure that the correct amount of adrenal tissue is destroyed.

**Ketoconazole** (also called nizoral) is an antifungal drug, with a
side effect of suppressing production of cortisol. This drug doesn't
require monitoring tests like lysodren, but it's very expensive and
takes longer to work.

**L-deprenyl** (also called Anipryl or [Selegiline) acts by a very
different mechanism, suppressing ACTH release by the pituitary. It
doesn't require monitoring tests, but is expensive, and not all dogs
respond to it. ]

**Trilostane** (also called Vetoryl ) inhibits the
production of cortisol. It typically has fewer side effects than
lysodren. Note: The FDA approved the use of Trilostane on May 11,
2009 and this should help with availability. Per a [letter to
veterinarians](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411010108/https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/vetoryl-trilostane-capsules-veterinarians)
from the FDA, "Now that VETORYL is approved and available for
veterinary use in the U.S., trilostane should not be imported from other
countries or compounded from bulk."

The following website has an excellent discussion of the pros and cons
of these different drug treatments:

If the cause of Cushing's is iatrogenic the treatment is to withdraw the
drug that caused it. This must be done gradually, because the drugs
causing iatrogenic Cushing's reduce adrenal production of cortisol. The
adrenals must be given time to recover and produce cortisol again.

If left untreated, a dog with Cushing's can develop additional
complications including diabetes, high blood pressure, congestive heart
failure, hypothyroidism, and liver and kidney failure. It can also lead
to increased infections since excess cortisol suppresses the immune
system.
