Cerebellar abiotrophy is a rare degenerative neurological condition that
affects the part of the brain that is responsible for balance and
coordination. The cerebellum develops normally and then at some point,
usually in a young animal, degeneration begins and symptoms appear.
Mental function remains normal. In Samoyeds the degeneration begins very
early, before or at birth, and the signs are apparent very early, when
they begin to walk. Abiotrophy is progressive and there is no effective
treatment. Eventually euthanasia is the best option for the involved
Samoyed. Other breeds, with a later onset and milder version of the
condition, can have a quality lifespan.

The degeneration is a result of a progressive dying off of certain neurons in the brain, specifically in the cerebellum, called Purkinje cells. These cells are responsible for communication between areas of the cerebellum that control balance and coordination. Without these cells, the sense of space and distance are lost and balance and coordination become impaired. Although "abiotrophy" means no nutritive factor, it is not actually known what causes the Purkinje cells to degenerate other than as a genetically inherited metabolic disease.

## Signs and Symptoms

- Poor coordination and balance
- Wide-based stance
- Stiff or high-stepping gait
- Clumsy movements, eventually progressing to inability to walk or
  even stand
- Tremors of head and sometimes the entire body

## Causes

Autosomal recessive gene inheritance.

Autosomal inheritance affects males and females equally in frequency and
severity, (unlike X-linked (sex-linked) diseases that affect males more
often and more seriously).

Recessive means an animal must have two copies of the defective gene,
receiving one copy from each parent. Thus both parents must carry the
gene. Carrier parents who have one copy of the gene are normal except
for their ability to pass on the gene, and they must be bred with
another carrier for the condition to show up. As the gene becomes more
common in a breed, the likelihood of both parents being a carrier
increases and the frequency of the disease begins to increase.

## Risk Factors

Known family member with the condition.

## Diagnostic Tests

There are no definitive tests. All routine tests are normal. Diagnosis
must rule out other neurological problems or infection. Usually the
clinical course of progression is sufficient to make the diagnosis. MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain might be helpful to
differentiate this condition from cerebellar hypoplasia which is similar
but is not progressive and has a better prognosis. Microscopic
examination of the brain at autopsy can be useful to verify the
diagnosis.

## Treatment Guidelines

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is no treatment. The condition is progressive and eventually a
decision is made to euthanize the dog due to poor quality of life.

## Management

Parents and siblings of affected dogs should not be bred. Known carriers
should not be bred.
