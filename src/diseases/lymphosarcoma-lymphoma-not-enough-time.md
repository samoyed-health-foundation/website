My male Akita had suffered from autoimmune problems his whole life. He
had environmental allergies from the time he was a year of age and has
been on either Prednisone or trimeprazine with prednisolone
(Temaril-P). This is my account:

Only 8 years with my dog...not enough time

The day before my dog was handed down a death sentence, I had given him
a bully stick. He ate his dinner but had become restless that night.
I thought he had diarrhea from the bully stick so I let him outside and
gave him some medication. I woke up the next morning and got ready for
work and fed him which he finished as usual. I still really did not
think anything was wrong. I took him into work with me (normal routine)
and noticed he was a bit dehydrated so I gave him 500 mls SQ
(subcutaneous) of LRS (Lactated Ringers). At lunch I brought him in for
his normal treats which he ate and took him for a walk. His urine was
extremely dark and concentrated so I gave him about 200mls more of LRS.
He then rolled on his side and I noticed a bulge sticking out of his
abdomen area. I checked his mucous membranes and they were very light
pink. Thinking this was the bully stick he had the night before, I
called in to his vet and thought he had an obstruction.

At the vet's we did 'in-house' blood work which revealed his PCV (packed
red cell volume, or hematocrit) ) was 25% (normal is 37-55%). We took
two x-rays of his abdomen and it revealed he did not have a stuck bully
stick but rather either his spleen or liver had ruptured. We opened him
up to find his spleen had ruptured. We sent two pieces of the spleen
for pathology to rule out Hemangiosarcoma. Within two days I was
relieved to see it was not Hemangiosarcoma. However, without further
tests they could not rule out a Myeloproliferative disease (such as
leukemia) or Lymphosarcoma. We ordered the needed tests since I had
decided to go ahead with chemotherapy and the two cancers are treated
differently. Five days later my boy was diagnosed with Stage IV T-Cell
Lymphosarcoma. My world was turned upside down.

I immediately switched him over to a low carbohydrate diet as studies
have shown cancer cells feed off carbohydrates and put him on Milk
Thistle to help cleanse the liver. I knew that maintaining weight on
cancer dogs is very important. My dog was put on a 3500 kcal/day diet
which included low carb kibble, canned, and raw foods.

The recuperation from the surgery was eventful. The incision was
looking good as he was on cephpodoxineI\* (Simplicef) for one week.
After his last dose, he started to be uncomfortable by pacing and
panting, as well as being bloated. So much so his back was roached like
a whippet. We went back to the clinic and did a PCV and X-rays. His
PCV was only 26% and his x-rays revealed he was bloating in the
intestines. We started him on simethicone (Phazyme, Gas-X) to help
reduce the gas build up and metoclopromide (Reglan) to help his bowels
be more productive. Two days later on a Sunday, he crashed again; this
time he had no energy to get up. I met one of the other technicians at
the clinic and we did a PCV which was only 20%. By this time, his gas
build up was under control so we put him 90 mg of prednisone. By the
evening, he had energy enough to stand up and walk around. The next day
we drew more blood to see if the bone marrow was involved. The results
indicated a high reticulocyte count which means he was trying to
regenerate RBC (Red Blood Cells) and his bone marrow was not involved.
We scheduled an ultrasound with another doctor the next day. His
echocardiogram looked good and there were no other tumors found in his
abdomen cavity. With this diagnosis, we proceeded with the chemo
therapy treatment.

His vet initially wanted to do the VELCAP-S protocol however three weeks
post surgery we started the L-VCA Short protocol. This protocol uses
Vincristine IV, Cytoxan IV, doxorubicin IV (adriamycin), and
Prednisone. One or more of the IV drugs were given at one week
intervals except for the Prednisone which was given orally, with the
Prednisone dosage reduced every week. Before each treatment, an
'in-house' blood panel was preformed to check his WBC (White Blood
Cells) count.

My dog did not have severe reactions to the drugs. His appetite was the
same but his stools did get a little loose. He did not lose any hair
however his energy level was a little low the evening after the
injection. His PCV was still low (27-29%) during his treatment and we
still did not know what was causing this. There was thought as to
internal hemorrhage from the surgery but he would have been dead earlier
if this were the case.

Two days after his third chemo injection, he refused his breakfast and
he was hunched over as if he were gassy. I checked his mucous membranes
and they were bright red. I took him to the clinic for x-rays as he was
whimpering, which is not like him. In the mean time, we gave him
injectable maropitant citrate (Cerenia) for nausea and Torbugesic for
pain. We did a series of barium x-rays as we thought there might have
been something suspicious in the stomach. We also did a series of
EKG's, his heart rate was very high A consult was ordered by another
doctor as we could not figure out what was going on. At 1 pm my dog
looked like he was relaxing so I went to work and took him with me since
there was nothing that could be done until the report came back from the
consultation. At 4 pm, he collapsed. I rushed him back to the clinic
and prepped him with a catheter. More blood work was done and his PCV
was 33% and mucous membranes were bright red. X-ray revealed fluid in
his lungs which was present and had not been visible in earlier x-rays
and his liver was extremely enlarged. We tried to administer oxygen by
mask but he refused it by turning his head away.

My friend who is a technician at the clinic looked up his symptoms in
the "5 Minute Consult" book. He had all the signs of severe hypovolemic
shock (shock due to low blood volume). His body was starving for oxygen
since he had such a low PCV number for 6 weeks. Then why was his PCV
higher now? When an animal is dehydrated, it can have a higher PCV.

I understood my dog was dying right before me and I could do nothing but
end his suffering...Which is what we did. The next day, the consult did
confirm severe hypovolemic shock.

\*NOTE: In reading up on this antibiotic, I had learned from the
company's website:

_"Blood dyscrasia including neutropenias, may be seen following high
doses of cephalosporins. Cephalosporin administration should be
discontinued in such cases."_

And

"_As with other cephalosporins, cefpodoxime proxetil may
occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs' test_"

(an indication of a body's autoimmune attack against its own red blood
cells)

<http://www.simplicef.com/Simplicef.aspx?country=US&species=OO&drug=SI&sec=000>

Other research has found that very high doses of cephalosporins can lead
to hemolytic anemia in dogs:

Bloom JC, et al. [Cephalosporin-induced immune cytopenia in the dog:
Demonstration of erythrocyte-, neutrophil- and platelet-associated IgG
following treatment with
cefazedone.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3394717/)
American Journal of Hematology, 28,(2): 71-18, 2006.

Whether or not this had anything to do with my dog's persistent
anemia I will never know. However, as a precaution I will not give my
dog cephalosporins after any surgery where there is a large amount
of blood loss such as a splenectomy.
