**Case History:** Male Samoyed, not diagnosed with SAS until 12 months of age. Diagnosed
with moderate SAS (Grade 4-6 murmur). All diagnostic tests were
completed. No arrythmias present in this dog. At first the dog was
placed on medications to reduce the load on the heart. However, meds
depressed the dog so much, it was decided to let him limit himself and
'do his thing'........Dog lived a NORMAL life until 6 years of age, when
he just didn't wake up one morning. Dog never developed any infections,
was neutered (under anesthetic), and was generally kept normally, fed
normally and was quite content and pain free.

This would be the mid-line result of SAS. A milder SAS would allow a
dog to live is full life, a severe SAS would cause the dog's heart to
wear out and the aorta burst at about 2-3 years (or before).
