## Summary

White Shaker Dog Syndrome (WSDS) manifests in a fairly specific,
generalized tremor pattern usually affecting the head and body of the
dog.  It can be mildly inconvenient for the dog or totally
incapacitating, depending on the severity.  WSDS was given this name
because it was historically recognized in small breed white dogs such as
the Maltese, West Highland White Terrier and poodle, although dogs with
all coat colors are now recognized as being susceptible.

Because of the response to steroids and the recognition of this syndrome
in breeds other than those with a white hair coat, this disease is also
referred to as Steroid Responsive Tremor Syndrome.  Another name for the
disease is Idiopathic Cerebellitis \[inflammation of the cerebellum
(part of the brain) with unknown cause].

## Signs and Symptoms

The primary sign of WSDS is tremors which can range from mild, causing
incapacity, to severe. The dog may shake for prolonged periods.  Shaking
can worsen with movement (intention tremor), and ease with relaxation or
sleep.  In breeds other than Samoyeds, it usually starts in dogs under
three years old.  Head tilting, limb weakness and seizures are
occasionally associated with the syndrome.  Mild to moderate hypermetria
(limb movements miss their target) is sometimes evident.  Commonly there
are rapid, random eye movements as well.

Note:  There is research being done on tremors in Samoyeds caused by
hypomyelination.  These tremors are seen in very young (several weeks
old) puppies. This is not WSDS, but for further information, look at the
Current Research section below.

## Causes

It is not known why WSDS occurs.  It has been speculated that the
tremors are due to an immune reaction targeted against
tyrosine-producing cells.

There is also conjecture that it can be congenital in some breeds.

## Diagnostic Tests

WSDS is diagnosed by excluding other possible causes for tremors, and by
looking for a response to corticosteroid treatment.

The things to be eliminated are primarily, but not restricted to;

* Ingestion of chemical or plant toxins such as organophosphates,
  hexachlorophene and bromethalin
* Congenital diseases that cause insufficient
  myelination (hypomyelination) in the CNS
* Ingestion of mycotoxins (toxins produced by fungi)
* Side effects from existing drug therapies
* Bacterial and viral encephalitis, which may be caused by canine
  distemper virus, adenovirus, parvovirus, herpes virus and tick-borne
  diseases.  Cerebrospinal fluid is evaluated for cytology as well as
  titers for the suspected agent.

A complete physical, neurological and orthopedic examination should be
performed.  A CBC and chemistry panel is performed to evaluate body
systems and look for metabolic dysfunction.  A cerebrospinal fluid tap
may be performed.  The cerebrospinal fluid analysis in WSDS often
reveals a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (increased white cells),
indicative of inflammation. It may however be normal.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed

> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Most dogs respond to an immunosuppressive dose of cortico-steroids
(prednisone), or to diazepines.  Sometimes both drugs are given.
Tremors generally resolve the first week or two after starting therapy.
The dose is then decreased or discontinued completely.  Should the
tremors return, the therapy is restarted at the initial dose until the
tremors are controlled, then decreased again. Some dogs respond quickly
to treatment and do not need additional treatments.  Other dogs need to
stay on low dose treatment to keep the tremors under control.

## Management

White Shaker Dog Syndrome is a disease usually found in smaller breeds
of dogs. For a Samoyed to be diagnosed with this is very rare.
 Exercise, stress or excitement can cause the shaking to start. In an
active Samoyed it is difficult to limit exercise and they are often
excitable.

The disease is usually controllable, and rarely fatal, but sometimes not
curable.  It can be incapacitating.

## Support Groups

There does not appear to be a support group specifically for this.
However, some of the 'small white dog' groups would seem to be of
service.
