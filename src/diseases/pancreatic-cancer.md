Tumors of the pancreas are of two types: exocrine (involving cells which
produce digestive enzymes) and endocrine (involving cells which produce
hormones). Tumors of either type can be benign (adenomas) or
malignant/cancerous (adenocarcinomas). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly
and often are amenable to surgical removal. Malignant tumors,
particularly exocrine cancers, grow rapidly, metastasize early and carry
a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic cancer is rare in dogs. Some breeds,
including Samoyeds, are said to be more prone to pancreatic cancers than
other breeds, although this has not been reported for Samoyeds in the
scientific literature. Older dogs (of any breed) are more likely to
develop pancreatic cancers. Malignant pancreatic tumors are more common
than benign ones. Exocrine cancers are more common than endocrine.
Exocrine cancers are the most common and have the poorest prognosis.

## Signs and Symptoms

**Exocrine tumors:** Signs and symptoms of exocrine tumors are vague and
generalized. Benign tumors are typically small and may not cause many
symptoms. Malignant tumors, being fast growing, are larger and cause
symptoms sooner, including pain, vomiting and weight loss. An abdominal
mass may be palpable. Jaundice may be present because of blockage by the
tumor of the bile ducts, and abdominal swelling may be present from
accumulation of fluid (ascites). The tumor may also block the intestine.
Leakage of digestive enzymes may cause the death of surrounding tissue
which can be very painful. The course of malignant disease is rapid.
**Endocrine tumors:** Endocrine tumors produce excessive hormones that
affect other parts of the body. The most common are those that involve
the cells that make insulin (insulinomas or beta cell tumors, usually
malignant) which results in low blood sugar concentrations. This causes
signs of weakness, confusion, collapse, possible convulsions and coma.
There are other rare endocrine pancreatic tumors including gastrinomas
(produce excess stomach acid causing ulcers and pain) and glucagonomas
(induce high blood glucose levels and liver damage.)

## Causes

Pancreatic cancers, since they are more common in some breeds than
others, are thought to perhaps have a genetic component but the causes
of cancer are certainly multifactorial and not well understood.

## Risk Factors

No known specific risk factors

## Diagnostic Tests

Malignant tumors may be large enough to be palpable. X-rays and
ultrasound may show abnormalities of the pancreas but will not indicate
whether the abnormality is cancer or not. Routine blood work is not
helpful but blood tests for levels of specific endocrine hormones, such
as insulin, may be useful in diagnosing endocrine tumors. There are no
blood tests for exocrine tumors. Ultimate diagnosis requires abdominal
operation and biopsy

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

**Exocrine tumors:** There is no adequate treatment for exocrine
pancreatic tumors. They grow too rapidly and metastasize early; they are
rarely if ever discovered early enough for treatment. **Endocrine
tumors:** The signs and symptoms of endocrine tumors can be ameliorated
by managing the excess of the specific hormone (insulin, gastrin,
glucagon). Benign tumors can be removed or partially removed but tend to
grow back. Life expectancy for dogs with endocrine pancreatic tumors is
generally less than a year but may extend up to 16-18 months. Sometimes
the pancreas is removed and the dog is managed with hormone replacement
(endocrine) and typically fed intravenously since it is too complicated
to replace the digestive enzymes of the exocrine pancreas. Again life
expectancy is short, even with surgery, for malignant tumors because
metastasis has almost always occurred by the time of diagnosis. For
patients with endocrine tumors for whom surgical therapy is not an
option, medical therapy may be tried. This includes dietary management
and the use of sugar solutions rubbed on the dog's gums during
hypoglycemic episodes. Corticosteroids are used if dietary management is
unsuccessful. Diazoxide, a medication which inhibits the secretion of
insulin may also be helpful. As in humans, radiation therapy and
chemotherapy are not helpful. Prognosis is guarded in any case.
