Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia is a decreased numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) due to destruction by the
immune system.

## Signs and Symptoms

- weakness and/or loss of energy
- decreased interest in food
- dark urine
- pale gums
- jaundice (yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes)
- enlarged spleen
- a slight fever may be present.

## Causes

In many cases (60-70%), a cause isn't found. In some cases, a primary
reaction by the immune system precedes the act of red blood cell
destruction.

The immune system (lymphocytes) begins to attack the body's own RBCs
with destructive antibodies. RBCs normally carry oxygen to tissues, and
carry away waste. Iron and bilirubin are sent to the liver in larger
amounts than normal causing jaundice and impaired liver function.

Altered liver function, lack of adequate tissue oxygen, and
complications of blood clot formation can be life-threatening.

## Risk Factors

Cancer (e.g. hemangiosarcoma) and drugs can trigger the immune system to
overreact. (The immune system starts targeting proteins that resemble
the drug; RBCs are destroyed as "innocent bystanders"). Examples of
implicated drugs include trimethoprim-sulfa and methimazole.

## Diagnostic Tests

Blood cell counts can determine if the numbers of red blood cells are
normal or too low (anemia). Anemia can occur from bleeding or from
increased RBC destruction (IMHA).

The bone marrow tries to make more RBCs to replace the destroyed, mature
RBCs. Because the bone marrow can't keep up with the destruction,
immature forms of RBCs ("reticulocytes" and "nucleated RBCs") may be
released into the blood.

Additional testing can determine if the bone marrow is not responding.
This may be temporary and resolve, or persist.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

- Prednisone and dexamethasone for immunosuppression.
- Azathioprine if no response to above.
- Transfusion when a crisis occurs.
