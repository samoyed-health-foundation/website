From the FDA:

> On March 15, 2007, FDA learned that certain pet foods were sickening
> and killing cats and dogs. FDA found contaminants in vegetable proteins
> imported into the United States from China and used as ingredients in
> pet food.
>
> A portion of the tainted pet food was used to produce farm animal feed
> and fish feed. FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture discovered
> that some animals that ate the tainted feed had been processed into
> human food. Government scientists have determined that there is very low
> risk to human health from consuming food from animals that ate tainted
> feed. All tainted pet food, animal and fish feed, and vegetable proteins
> continue to be recalled and destroyed.
>
> As a result of FDA and USDA's comprehensive investigation, on February
> 6, 2008, FDA announced that two Chinese nationals and the businesses
> they operate, along with a U.S. company and its president and chief
> executive officer, were indicted by a federal grand jury for their roles
> in a scheme to import products purported to be wheat gluten into the
> United States that were contaminated with melamine.
