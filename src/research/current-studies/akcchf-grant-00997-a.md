"Conjunctivitis, also referred to as \"pink eye,\" is inflammation of
the tissues around the eye and results in redness, swelling, discharge,
and discomfort of the eyes. Conjunctivitis occurs frequently in the dog
and is among the most common eye diseases for which dogs are presented
to primary care veterinary clinics and ophthalmology referral practices.
There are numerous recognized causes of conjunctivitis; however, in many
dogs with this condition a specific cause can not be identified. These
dogs are treated with medications that are frequently ineffective in
controlling the problem or occasionally exacerbate the condition. In
humans and numerous other animal species, viruses are among the most
frequent causes of conjunctivitis. Despite this fact, viruses have never
been thoroughly investigated as a cause of this problem in the dog.

This research is intended to determine if viruses are potential causes
of conjunctivitis in the dog. This information will increase our
understanding of conjunctivitis in the dog and may lead to improved
treatments and reduced incidence of conjunctivitis by preventing
transmission between dogs."
