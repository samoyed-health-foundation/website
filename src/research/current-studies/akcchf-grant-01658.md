## Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease to Prevent Kidney Damage

## Mary B Nabity, DVM, PhD, Texas A&M AgriLife Research

## Abstract from AKCCHF.org website:

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant source of illness and death in dogs, affecting up to 15% of elderly individuals. Dysfunction of the kidney filtration system is most often the cause of CKD. Early treatment generally prolongs the lives of dogs with CKD, but timely detection can be difficult and the outcome for each patient is unpredictable due to our lack of ability to rapidly diagnose disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate promising indicators of kidney injury that might improve detection and/or assessment of progression or prognosis in dogs with CKD. Dr. Nabity will use urine samples from dogs with various kidney diseases to measure: 1) urinary proteins indicating tubular and glomerular damage, and 2) gene expression profiles indicating loss of kidney cells. Results will be correlated with conventional measures of kidney function, kidney biopsy findings, and information regarding disease outcome to determine the utility of the novel tests to non-invasively detect and accurately assess kidney damage in dogs.
