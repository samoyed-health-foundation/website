Single Dose Extended Release Anticonvulsant Shows Promise.

\"Epilepsy is a serious, late-onset seizure disorder that affects a
large number of breeds and usually requires lifelong treatment. Dogs
often develop a tolerance to therapy, so increasingly higher doses of
anticonvulsants are needed. Previous studies showed that levetiracetam
(commercially known as Keppra), a human antiepileptic drug, is well
tolerated by dogs, even at concentrations that exceed the maximum
therapeutic range for humans. The drug also shows promise in controlling
seizures. However, the halflife of levetiracetam is short in dogs.

Researchers, funded by Morris Animal Foundation, studied the
effectiveness in dogs of a new extended-release Keppra product that was
recently approved for human-use. They found that the extended-release
version levetiracetam is a safe, convenient anticonvulsant drug that can
be given to dogs in a single oral dose with a longer half-life. These
data suggest that the new product would be a better treatment option and
would provide better long-term management of seizures in dogs with
epilepsy."
