**Morris Grant D25CA-033:** A Novel, Multi-Faceted Gene Therapy Approach to Osteoarthritis in Dogs

**Principal Investigator:** Laurie Goodrich, DVM

**Institution:** Colorado State University

**Project Description:**
SUMMARY: Researchers will use a new gene therapy approach to treat osteoarthritis in dogs.

THE PROBLEM: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a long-term disease that causes pain in the joints and limits physical activity for those affected by it. This disease affects not only humans but also dogs, with as many as 20% of dogs affected. The pain and reduced activity levels can have debilitating effects on a dogâ€™s overall health, preventing them engaging in many activities. There are some OA treatments available such as pain medications, joint supplements, and even surgical management. However, these treatments only focus on providing temporary relief to pets and does not slow further damage. New treatment options are needed to directly treat OA and heal the damage.

THE PROJECT: The team will create a next generation gene therapeutic that will directly act on the cells in the joint. Their goal is to encourage the cells in the joint to produce specific proteins that will not only control inflammation but also stimulate tissue regeneration.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: If successful, this treatment could offer relief to the millions of dogs affected by osteoarthritis and provide a new therapeutic tool for veterinarians.

Projected End Date: 11/30/2026
