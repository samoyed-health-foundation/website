Dogs suffer from many orthopedic, neurological and cardiovascular
injuries and diseases that could be treated with cell replacement
therapies. One potential therapy is the use of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), which are artificially produced by reprogramming adult
cells back to an embryonic state, thereby giving them the ability to
grow indefinitely in culture and the potential to turn into any cell
type. These iPSCs have enormous therapeutic potential because they can
be used to grow genetically identical cells for use in transplantations
without risk of being rejected by the dog's immune system. To date,
iPSCs have been successfully derived from adult human, mouse, monkey,
pig, horse and sheep cells, but little has been done in dogs. The
researcher will determine the factors and culture conditions required to
generate canine iPSCs. This study will form the basis of future work to
further characterize iPSCs and determine their potential to be used
therapeutically in dogs and as a novel tool for studying canine
inherited diseases.
