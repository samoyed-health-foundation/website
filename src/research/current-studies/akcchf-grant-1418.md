**Abstract**

Lymphoma is the most common malignancy of dogs representing up to 25% of
diagnosed cancers. Dogs often develop an aggressive form of lymphoma
that is rarely curable, with most unfortunately succumbing to disease
within 12 months of diagnosis despite best-available chemotherapies. We
seek to develop a new treatment to re-train the dog's own immune system
to attack the most common type of canine lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma. We
plan to obtain a small number of circulating white blood cells, called T
cells, from the blood of affected dogs and insert a gene that will cause
the T cell to express a receptor which recognizes the tumor
"fingerprint". After docking with the lymphoma, the T cell will be
triggered to mount an immune response against the tumor cells with the
specific fingerprint. This therapy could be used alone or in combination
with chemotherapy. Our preliminary data demonstrate that we can indeed
express a desired immunoreceptor in genetically modified T cells and we
show that it is possible to harvest and grow T cells in the laboratory
and return them safely to the dog. Furthermore, the infused cells can be
found in the blood and tumor weeks after infusion, showing that it is
possible for these cells to survive in the dog. These data support our
plans to develop first-in-dog T-cell therapy targeting a tumor that is
basically untreatable.
