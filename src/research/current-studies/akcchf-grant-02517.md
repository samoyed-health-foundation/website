## AKCCHF Grant 02517: Genetics of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma in the Siberian Husky

Glaucoma is a very painful and rapidly blinding disease that 
leads to irreversible sight loss in many thousands of dogs in the USA 
and worldwide each year. Current medical and surgical treatments that 
target the damaging high pressure in the eyes of affected dogs are not 
able to cure the disease but only control it. In many dogs with 
glaucoma, surgical removal of both eyes is needed to control pain. Past 
research reveals that the Siberian Husky is one of the more commonly 
affected breeds in both North America and Europe. With improvements in 
canine DNA sequencing tools, it is now possible to carry out very 
detailed sequencing of DNA of individual dogs, and these techniques have
 identified mutated genes responsible for several dog diseases. The 
investigators in this study will analyze DNA from Siberian Huskies with 
glaucoma and compare it to DNA from dogs without glaucoma. The goal is 
to identify the DNA mutation (or mutations) that cause glaucoma and, in 
turn, develop a genetic test for the disease in this breed and possibly 
other affected breeds such as the Samoyed and Shiba Inu. A DNA test 
would provide an important tool in efforts to fight this disease as dog 
breeders could develop more informed breeding strategies, with a goal to
 ultimately help eliminate this disease from the dog population.
