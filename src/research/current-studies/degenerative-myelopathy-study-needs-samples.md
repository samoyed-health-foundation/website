We are pleased to announce a Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) study being conducted by Dr Mary Whiteley. DM has been a passion that Dr. Whiteley has been working on for years. She has had support from other breeds and had asked for a random sampling from SCARFâ€™s DNA bank.

With a tiny DNA sample from only 10 samoyeds, she found a unique link in the disease in the Samoyed breed. Since that spring announcement Dr. Whiteley has had a breakthrough with an assay leading toward Diagnostic testing. She is working to get to the mutation.

If you live with a Samoyed that is suspected of having DM or has been diagnosed with DM you could be an important part of this study. Contact Dr. Mary Whitely at [DOGenes Inc](https://www.dogenes.com/contactus2.html) to find out how your Samoyed can help.
