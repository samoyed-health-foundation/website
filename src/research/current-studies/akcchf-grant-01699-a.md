### Preventing Inaccurate Diagnosis of Brucellosis

### Christina M Larson, DVM, University of Minnesota

### Abstract from AKCCHF.org website:

Brucellosis testing is often made difficult due to the fact that the most commonly-used Brucellosis test, the Rapid Slide Agglutination Test (RSAT) also gives false positive results when the dog has recently experienced a bacterial infection due to Bordetella bronchiseptica, which is one of the common causes of kennel cough. Vaccinating the dog by injection of Bordetella (kennel cough) vaccine is likely to cause false positive results on the RSAT. This study will evaluate whether false positive RSAT results are obtained after vaccinating the dog via nasal spray with a commercially-available Bordetella (kennel cough) vaccine.
