**Monique Dore, DVM PhD, University of Montreal.**

**Molecular Control of Prostaglandin Synthesis in Canine Mammary
Tumors**

So far, Dr. Doré's research has shown \"that COX-2 was not expressed in
the normal (mammary) gland but was detected in 24% of adenomas and in
56% of adenocarcinomas (P \< 0.001).\" Dr. Doré continued this research
with [AKCCHF grant
\#00366](/research/current-studies/akcchf-grant-0366).
