**Project Description:** _Bartonella_, a genus of gram-negative bacteria, are associated with a wide spectrum of life-threatening diseases in animals and humans. More than 40 _Bartonella_ species have been reported to infect mammalian reservoir hosts, and infection often leads to chronic bacteremia. At least ten _Bartonella_ species have been implicated in association with serious diseases in dogs, including endocarditis, hemangiosarcoma, myocarditis, peliosis hepatis, polyarthritis and vasculitis. Despite biomedical advances and ongoing research in the field of canine bartonelloses, currently available PCR, culture, and serological based assays lack sensitivity for diagnosis of bartonelloses. Dogs throughout the United States and much of the world are exposed to _Bartonella_ species. From a public health perspective there is an increased risk of direct and vector-borne transmission of _Bartonella_ species from animals to humans. These factors justify the need for the ongoing development of a reliable serodiagnostic modality and ultimately an effective vaccine for prevention of bartonelloses in dogs. We will employ In-Vivo Induced Antigen Technology (IVIAT) to identify _Bartonella_ in-vivo induced antigens, which will allow us to evaluate their potential as diagnostic markers for canine bartonelloses. This proposed study will result in development of a novel and sensitive ELISA assay for diagnosing _Bartonella_ infection in dogs and will provide insights into the development of effective vaccine candidates for preventing _Bartonella_ infection.
