**Project Description:** Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air in the space around the lungs without an obvious precipitating factor. This disease presents as a life-threatening emergency causing shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and possible collapse or sudden death.  The diagnosis of these lesions that cause spontaneous pneumothorax in dogs (known as pulmonary bullae) remains challenging. The accuracy of advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) for identifying bulla in dogs with spontaneous pneumothorax is limited. Currently, thorough exploration of the chest through an open surgical approach is the diagnostic standard for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. This strategy, however, requires an invasive surgical approach and weeks of post-operative recovery.  In contrast, video-assisted scoping (thoracoscopy) of the chest, known as VATS, is preferred to open surgery for the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax in human medicine. VATS is associated with fewer complications and reduced post-operative pain, making it a desirable alternative to the current standard in veterinary medicine, but its reliability in correctly identifying pulmonary bullae associated with spontaneous pneumothorax in dogs has not yet been proven. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the ability of thoracoscopy to identify and localize pulmonary bullae in dogs with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, thus facilitating minimally invasive treatment options for dogs with this disease.
