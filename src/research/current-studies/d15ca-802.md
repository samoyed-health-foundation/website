**Scientific Title:  Animal Assistance Therapy:  Ensuring Animal Health
and Program Sustainability in the Context of Hospital-associated
Infections**

**\
Dr. Allen R. Chen, Johns Hopkins University**

_Update July 2018:  [Final Report](</files/D15CA-802 FinalReport.pdf>)_

*Summary:*  Researchers will determine whether the fur of animal
assistance therapy dogs can become contaminated with hospital-associated
infections and test whether low-cost interventions can reduce the risk
of microbial transmission between therapy animals and patients with
childhood cancer.

*Description:*  Researchers will determine whether two common pathogens
that cause hospital-associated infections, Clostridium difficile and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, can be transferred between
assistance therapy dogs and children with cancer who are undergoing
outpatient treatment.  They will also investigate whether commercial
veterinary skin products can reduce transmission rates of these
pathogens.  The goal of this study is to improve the health of working
dogs and their \"patients\" by reducing bacterial infection risks.
