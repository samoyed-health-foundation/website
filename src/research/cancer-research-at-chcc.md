The Canine Hereditary Cancer Consortium includes researchers from a number of universities, research institutes and companies.  The Consortium received a Federally funded grant through the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute to study five types of cancer that occur in both dogs and humans. The ultimate goal is to develop improved diagnostics and more individualized therapies for both canines and people.

They are requesting the help of purebred dog owners, who may own a dog affected with one of these cancers. The five initial cancers they are studying are:

1. Hemangiosarcoma
2. Lymphoma
3. Osteosarcoma
4. Malignant histiocytosis
5. Melanoma of the mouth or toe

They are requesting fresh (NOT in formalin, NOT frozen) tissue samples from tumors, when pets have biopsies, surgeries such as splenectomies, or are euthanized. Samples may be collected post mortem, as the euthanasia solution does not affect the DNA in either the dog's blood or in the tumor cells.

They need 3-5 mls of whole blood in an EDTA (purple top) tube. It can be sent priority mail, and blood can be shipped at room temperature.

If the pet is scheduled for surgery or, sadly, euthanasia, if you or your veterinarian contact them ahead of time, they can FedEx a collection kit which includes an overnight FedEx return shipping form, along with collection media and containers.
