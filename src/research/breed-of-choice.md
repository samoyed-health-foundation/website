Why is the Samoyed the breed of choice for research?

- The dog genome sequence has been completed and "scientists found
  that humans share more of their ancestral DNA with dogs than with
  mice, confirming the utility of dog genetics for understanding
  human disease" (_Nature_ 12/8/05)

- Samoyeds are descended from the oldest ancestral line of dogs
  (_Science_, 5/21/04) and are therefore "living representatives of
  the ancestral gene pool".

- Historians of the Samoyed breed claim that the breed was
  derived from as few as 12 dogs.
  A [_National Geographic_ news article](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110819-dogs-wolves-russia-domestication-animals-science-evolution/) states
  that the Samoyed is one of 5 breeds considered "somewhat rare"
  and having "small breeding populations. There is not a lot of
  genetic diversity in these breeds, making sequencing easier, say
  researchers."

- Mapping genes associated with diseases common to both man and dogs
  can best be accomplished by taking advantage of the small gene
  pool from which Samoyeds descend.
