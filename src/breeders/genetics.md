# Registries

- Closed registries release only normal results to the public.
  - PennHIP and Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) are examples of closed registries.
  - Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) was a closed registry, originally.
  - Now OFA is a semi-closed registry. All normal results are still released, but abnormal results will only be released to the public with owner consent.
- Open registries would provide information on normals, affected and carriers.

- [OFA](https://www.ofa.org/) (hip, thyroid, pra, heart, sebaceous adentitis, etc.)

- [PennHIP](http://www.pennhip.org/)

- [CHIC](http://www.caninehealthinfo.org/) - The Canine Health Information
  Center, also known as CHIC, is a centralized canine health database
  jointly sponsored by the AKC/Canine Health Foundation (AKC/CHF) and the
  Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) For more information, the SCA
