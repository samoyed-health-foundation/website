# Samoyed Death Report Form

The purpose of this death report is to help keep other Samoyed owners
informed of possible health problems and help the Foundation seek and
select researchers to find causes, or solutions to health problems that
effect Samoyeds.

While some of this information may seem extraneous to you, at some
future date, researchers may be able to link some of the environmental
or phenotypical information you supply us to the reason your Samoyed has
died. Note: This form has no required fields. Please answer whatever
information your are comfortable with providing to us.

If you already had your Samoyed entered into the main database, just use
the same unique identification number when entering data into the death
report to link the databases together.

The information you provide will be reported by the DNA Bank to a
researcher or the Foundation, as anonymous statistical information. In
some cases, additional follow up information on your dog's death may be
important to a researcher. If you wish to be contacted for further
information on your dog, you must give **prior consent** to do so; [CLICK

Owners's consent form is located.\
\
Note: If your Samoyed's death was the result of an adverse reaction to
a product, please login to the Database entry page and fill out an
incident report form after completing the death report form.
