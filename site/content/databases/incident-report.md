# Samoyed Health Adverse Event Incident Reporting

The purpose of this incident report is to help keep other Samoyed owners
informed of possible health problems and help the Foundation seek and
select researchers to find causes, or solutions to health problems that
effect Samoyeds.

The data you supply on this form will be automatically entered into the
secure DNA Bank database. If you already have your Samoyed entered into
the main database, just use the same unique identification number when
entering data into the adverse event form to link the databases
together.

The information you provide will be reported by the DNA Bank to a
researcher or the Foundation, as anonymous statistical information. In
some cases, additional follow up information on your dog's condition
may be important for a scientific evaluation of the underlying cause of
your Samoyed's health incident. If you wish to be contacted for further
information on your dog's incident, you MUST give PRIOR CONSENT to do
so; [CLICK HERE](https://www.dogenes.com/members1.html) to go to the
page where the Owner Consent form is located.
