title: Become a liaison
---
You can help your breed and other owners by choosing to be a "Health Information Liaison".
There are approximately 60 documented disorders in the Samoyed breed.
We are asking for owners to volunteer to gather information on a disorder.

It is not necessary to have either a scientific background or have any working knowledge of websites to be a "Health Information Liaison".

The process is simple:

1. You would contact the e-mail address below and tell us you are interested in being a Liaison.
2. You would choose a disorder that is not covered by a Liaison. You would be given an outline of what type of information to collect on the disorder.
3. You would add information gathered about the disorder to the provided outline and forward to SCARF. 
4. Your expanded outline would be given to a reviewer with a science background. The reviewer will edit the text for scientific accuracy and rate the credibility of the links so the public understands how much significance to give to a resource. The text would then be uploaded to the public website.
5. You would be able to contact SCARF to request edits on your disorder-to add new information or delete old information.
6. Once a year you would be expected to review the information and look for additional current research.

If you would like to consider helping your breed by becoming a "Health Information Liaison", please contact
