You can help your breed and other owners by choosing to be a "Health Information Liaison".
There are approximately 60 documented disorders in the Samoyed breed.
We are asking for owners to volunteer to gather information on a disorder.

It is not necessary to have either a scientific background or have any working knowledge of websites to be a "Health Information Liaison".

The process is simple:

1. You would contact either of the e-mail addresses below and tell us you are interested in being a Liaison.
2. You would choose a disorder that is not covered by a Liaison. You would be given an outline of what type of information to collect on the disorder.
3. You would be approved and given access to the private level workstation. On that level you would cut and paste the information you have gathered on your disorder.
4. Your disorder will be assigned to someone who has a science background. That "Health Information Reviewer" will be notified by the web system that you have put up information for them to review.
5. The â€œHealth Information Reviewer's job is to edit the text for scientific accuracy and rate the credibility of the links so the public understands how much significant to give to a resource. The Reviewer would then select a tab to make the text visible on the public viewing website.
6. You would be able to go back into the system to do edits on your disorder-to add new information or delete old information when it is convenient for you.
