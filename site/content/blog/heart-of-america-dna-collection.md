The Heart of America Samoyed Club is hosting a DNA collection at its specialty event in Kansas City, MO on <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **Friday March 8, 2019** and <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **Saturday March 9, 2019** for the Samoyed Club of America Education & Research Foundation (SCARF).

The SCARF DNA collection will add anonymous, accurate, statistical data that will help SCARF report back to the public on the status of the Samoyed breed. Researchers can look into whether environmental factors have any correlation to a disorder, what adverse reactions dogs may have to a drug and what diseases are on the rise/fall through looking at the cause of death.

Cheek swabs are **FREE**. _Please bring dogâ€™s registration information and a 3-generation pedigree._
