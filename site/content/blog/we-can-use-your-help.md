Support your favorite breed by volunteering to help as a liaison or reviewer for the A to Z disorder section of the SCARF website!

There are three levels of assistance needed:

1. **Easiest:** Become a liaison for a disorder that already has a write-up but no liaison. Just check occasionally to see if the information on the website is up to date and look for any current research. These disorders have two asterisks \*\* in the a to z list.
2. **Most needed:** Become a liaison for a disorder that needs a write-up.  SCARF will supply an outline and suggest a few reference websites to get you started; you flesh out the outline with information about the disorder.  A reviewer will rate links and references and SCARF will upload to the website.
3. **Most technical:** Become a reviewer. Those with a medical or scientific background can review write-ups and rate links and references. We don’t need many reviewers until we have more liaisons but let’s hope we get more liaison volunteers soon!
