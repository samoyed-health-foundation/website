The Samoyed Club of America Education and Research Foundation (SCARF) will be holding a _free_ DNA Collection event at the SCA National Specialty in South Sioux City, NE on <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **Thursday, September 26, 2019** for the SCARF Samoyed DNA Repository.



The SCARF DNA collection will add anonymous, accurate, statistical data that will help SCARF report back to the public on the status of the Samoyed breed.



Researchers can investigate whether environmental factors have any correlation to a disorder, what adverse reactions dogs may have to a drug and what diseases are on the rise/fall through looking at the cause of death.



To participate you will need to set up an account, obtain a unique identification number for each Samoyed and complete the database form to the best of your ability for each Samoyed by September 19, 2019. Detailed information and instructions may be found here:

We hope to see you and your Samoyed(s) at the collection event this September!
