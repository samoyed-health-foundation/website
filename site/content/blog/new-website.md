The Samoyed Club of America Education and Research Foundation is very excited to finally go live with our long anticipated new website.

With so many links and so much information there will always be changing or broken links.
If you find a link that is in need of an update please help everyone who uses the site by contacting us at
[help@samoyedhealthfoundation.org](mailto:help@samoyedhealthfoundation.org)
and letting us know what you have discovered and where it is located.

In addition to the sweeping content corrections and updates, we also updated the design.

We offer a huge Thank You to SCARF Director Matt Odille for the many many volunteer hours it took for him to put so much updated information on the site.

It was a massive effort and one which we hope will be an asset to not just Samoyeds but dogs of all breeds and their people for years to come!
