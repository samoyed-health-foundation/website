SCARF will help fund cardiac exams and eye exams at the upcoming 2018 SCA National Specialty.

We will offer a $20 discount for all cardiac exams (up to 80 samoyeds).

If you elect to undergo the cardiac exam, we will also offer an additional $5 discount towards getting an eye exam.

We look forward to seeing you there!
