Our Scarf website is still in the process of upgrading the Memorial Wall feature to have a picture rotating on the Scarf home page of your beloved animal and it's name will have to be delayed until the upgrade is completed.
During this process, you can continue to add animals.

These Memorial Wall pages are a tribute to our beloved companions who have gone before us.
Because of their friendship and unconditional love, we are forever changed for the better.

Once completed, we will have a fitting tribute to your beloved buddy, who has shared your days and who lives on in your heart.
