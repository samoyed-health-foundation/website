<h3>Our Mission</h3>
</div>

The SCA Education and Research Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit corporation, recognized by the IRS as a 501(&#99;)(3) organization - devoted to improving the  health of the Samoyed breed.

The mission of the Foundation is to provide financial aid and other support for medical research to benefit the health and quality of life of the Samoyed breed; and to develop and communicate educational health information to Samoyed owners, Samoyed breeders, veterinarians and the research community.

The Foundation funds research focusing on the disorders that have been historically occurring in the Samoyed breed.

The Foundation funds research investigations in Samoyed disorders that will promote:

1. The prevention of spreading disorders through the Samoyed gene pool by developing genetic testing for culprit gene/genes.

2. The curing of a disease through identification of the culprit gene/genes and the development of medications and treatments for the disorder.

3. The control of a disease progress through improved medications, treatments and therapies by conventional medicines and holistic venues.

The Foundation will not fund research investigations that involve Samoyed or dog research colonies, cloning, projects involving disease induction or injury models in Samoyeds/dogs and euthanasia of healthy canines.

The Foundation will promote the health of the Samoyed breed among owners by providing educational endeavors, which support a breederâ€™s knowledge on health issues.
All decisions regarding breeding, testing, and registries are the legitimate right of a Samoyed owner and are not the function of the Foundation.
