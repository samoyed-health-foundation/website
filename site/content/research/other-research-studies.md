<p class="lead">While the following studies are not being funded by SCARF, they may be of interest to Samoyed owners:</p>

**[Canine Genome Project](/research/canine-genome-research-at-the-ostrander-lab)** -
The Ostrander Laboratory at the National Human Genome Research Institute at
NIH is soliciting donations of blood samples from pure bred dogs for
canine health research.
They are working on projects to help reduce the
incidence of inherited diseases, and to understand disease patterns
across breeds...

**[Canine Epilepsy Research](http://www.canine-epilepsy.net/cerc.html)** -
needed are samples from a large number of affected individuals and their immediate
family members (siblings, parents, and grandparents), from many breeds of dogs.

**The University of Missouri is currently conducting a genetic marker
study on glaucoma.**

"Participation by the owners of affected dogs and their relatives is
essential to the success of this project. Researchers need DNA samples
from dogs who have been diagnosed with glaucoma or lens luxation, and
immediate relatives (all available siblings, parents, grandparents, and
offspring if the affected dog has been bred). Clinically normal dogs in
these families are as important to sample as the affected dogs. Complete
or nearly complete families are critical to the success of this
research. Participation in the project is confidential -- the names of
individual owners or dogs will not be
revealed."...[more](/research/glaucoma-research)

**[Genetic diseases](https://www.vetgen.com/research-you-help.html)** -
VetGen is interested in collecting samples from families of dogs in
which two or more are affected with a genetic disease.
