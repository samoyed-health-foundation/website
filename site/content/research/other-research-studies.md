<p class="lead">While the following studies are not being funded by SCARF, they may be of interest to Samoyed owners:</p>

Thank you to everyone who participates in any study to help our breed.  Please understand that the organizations performing the studies listed here will keep your dog’s DNA and information for their use only.  Please also consider donating swabs and data to the SCARF databank.  It is the only anonymous, not-for-profit DNA/data bank owned and held in trust by and for the Samoyed breed.  This would insure that DNA from all of your dogs (both healthy and affected Samoyeds) will be preserved to help in future studies for treatments and cures. For further information see DNA/data questions and answers on this website or contact SCARF's president at [president@samoyedhealthfoundation.org](mailto:president@samoyedhealthfoundation.org)
