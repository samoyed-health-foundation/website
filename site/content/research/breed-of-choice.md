Why is the Samoyed the breed of choice for research?

- The dog genome sequence has been completed and "scientists found
that humans share more of their ancestral DNA with dogs than with
mice, confirming the utility of dog genetics for understanding
human disease" (*Nature* 12/8/05)

- Samoyeds are descended from the oldest ancestral line of dogs
(*Science*, 5/21/04) and are therefore "living representatives of
the ancestral gene pool".

- Historians of the Samoyed breed claim that the breed was
derived from as few as 12 dogs.
A [*National Geographic* news article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1210_021210_doggenome.html) states
that the Samoyed is one of 5 breeds considered "somewhat rare"
and having "small breeding populations. There is not a lot of
genetic diversity in these breeds, making sequencing easier, say
researchers."

- Mapping genes associated with diseases common to both man and dogs
can best be accomplished by taking advantage of the small gene
pool from which Samoyeds descend.
