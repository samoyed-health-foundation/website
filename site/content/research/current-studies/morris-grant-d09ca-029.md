Scarf has re-directed the funds from discontinued study D09CA-082 to
this study.

***Project Summary from MAF website:***

"Lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in dogs and sadly is fatal
in most patients. Though the underlying causes of the disease aren't
understood, exposure to industrial pollutants and commonly used
herbicides may increase a dog's risk of lymphoma. Research shows that
humans exposed to environmental chemicals have a higher risk for
developing lymphoma, and genetic defects in the enzymes that remove
environmental chemicals from the body increase this risk. This study
will determine whether dogs with genetic defects in an important
detoxification enzyme, called GSTT, are more likely to develop lymphoma.
The results will provide insight into the genetic and environmental risk
factors for lymphoma in dogs."
