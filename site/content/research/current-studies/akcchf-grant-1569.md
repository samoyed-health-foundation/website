**Final Research Summary:**

Canine lymphoma is one of the most common cancers encountered in
veterinary oncology.  While most canine multicentric lymphoma patients
initially respond to currently available chemotherapy protocols,
response rates are considerably lower in patients with cutaneous T cell
lymphoma (CTCL), and generally brief in duration.  We previously
demonstrated the effectiveness of the novel cancer drug GS-9219 in dogs
with multicentric lymphoma, in which 100% of chemotherapy-naïve and 60%
of chemotherapy-relapsed patients experienced responses.  One of the
observed toxicities in GS-9219 treated dogs was a skin change
characterized by hair loss, redness and itching, implying significant
delivery of GS-9219 to the skin. Given the lack of durable effective
therapy for canine CTCL, and the demonstrated antilymphoma activity and
apparent skin accumulation of GS-9219, we propose to evaluate the
effectiveness of GS-9219 in canine CTCL through the completion of a
phase-II clinical trial.  Dogs with chemotherapy-naive or relapsed,
histologically confirmed CTCL will receive GS- 9219 as a 30-minute
intravenous infusion once every 21 days.  The primary endpoint will be
objective response rate.  Secondary endpoints will include
progression-free survival, as well as acute and cumulative adverse
effects.  Successful demonstration of efficacy of GS-9219 against canine
CTCL would provide an important drug in the veterinarian's
armamentarium against this challenging disease.
