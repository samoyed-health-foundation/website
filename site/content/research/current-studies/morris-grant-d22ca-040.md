Investigating a Novel Drug Therapy for Heart Disease

Joshua Stern, University of California, Cavis

Grant Period 11/1/21-10/31/23



Subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) is one of the most common congenital heart defects in dogs. SAS leads to heart remodeling (physical and functional changes in the heart), cardiac arrhythmias and frequently results in sudden death. No current medical therapy prolongs the lifespan of dogs with severe SAS beyond 4 to 5 years of age. Â Researchers will conduct a clinical trial to investigate whether the drug rapamycin can reduce the life-threatening heart remodeling associated with SAS. The team hopes this novel therapy may reduce disease severity and improve outcomes and quality of life for dogs with this devastating disease.
