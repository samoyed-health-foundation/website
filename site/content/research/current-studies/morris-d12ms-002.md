Mammary rumors are among the most common cancers in female dogs and
cats. Surgical removal is the most widely accepted treatment option for
mammary tumors in small companion animals, but this treatment has a high
incidence of tumor recurrence and metastatic diseases. There is an
urgent need for a better understanding of the genes involved in tumor
suppression. One tumor suppressor gene, SYK, has been little studied but
appears to effect breast tumor development and aggressiveness in humans.
Accumulating evidence indicates that mammary stem cells are the primary
target cells for cancer development, and SYK has been found in the
mammary cells or dogs and cats. The researchers will examine SYK and
mammary stem cells and their role in cancer development in an effort to
better understand how different genes affect mammary tumors.
