***Project Summary from the AKCCHF.org website:***

"Osteosarcoma is an aggressive canine bone cancer, accounting for around
6% of all canine cancers. Even with the standard-of-care therapy of
amputation and chemotherapy, the prognosis is poor, with most dogs dying
due to tumor spread (metastasis) within one year, and less than 20%
surviving to 2 years following diagnosis. Therefore, improved strategies
to treat metastatic disease are needed.

Using a novel approach, Dr. Smith has engineered a virus to multiply in
and kill tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Preliminary studies
have demonstrated that this virus-based anti-tumor treatment is safe
when administered to canine osteosarcoma patients and is potentially
efficacious in treating osteosarcoma. While this virus was hypothesized
to kill osteosarcoma cells through its replication, Dr. Smith\'s
research team hypothesizes that the viral vector may also stimulate an
anti-tumor immune response in addition to the expected anti-viral
response. In this study, the efficacy and mechanism of action of the
virus-based anti-tumor treatment will be evaluated."
