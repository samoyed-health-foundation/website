**Identifying the Genetic Cause of Canine Hip Dysplasia**

**George J. Brewer, MD, University of Michigan**

This study was completed at the end of 2003.  Their objectives were to
evaluate 13 candidate genes as causal for canine hip dysplasia (CHD). 
All of the selected genes were analyzed, but no linkage was found to CHD
in any of the breeds studied.  Samoyed samples were included in this
study.
