*Description:*  Researchers will investigate the efficacy of a new treatment for dogs with abnormally high urinary protein levels associated with kidney disease.

*Summary:*  Abnormally high protein levels in the urine, known as proteinuria, can be an early indicator and a serious complicating condition of kidney disease in dogs.  Currently, use of the
standard-of-care drug enalapril can help improve outcomes, but this
intervention is only partially effective at reducing proteinuria. 
Researchers will evaluate an alternative drug, telmisartan, and its
ability to reduce urinary protein loss in dogs with proteinuria.  In
this clinical trial, client-owned dogs will be randomly assigned to
receive either telmisartan or enalapril over a four-month period. 
Researchers will measure urine protein levels to gauge the effectiveness
of both treatments.  If telmisartin is more effective, this new drug
could safely reduce proteinuria and decrease morbidity and mortality in
dogs with kidney disease.
