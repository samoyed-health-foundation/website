**Understanding the Genetic Basis for Urinary Stones**

**Dr. Ned Patterson, University of Minnesota**

***Summary from the MorrisAnimalFoundation.org website:***

"Urinary stones are common in dogs, especially in Miniature Schnauzers,
which are 10 to 20 times more at risk than other breeds. Surgical
removal of the stones is usually the only cure for this painful disease.
 Preventive measures are lacking and recurrence rates are high. Pedigree
analysis of Miniature Schnauzers enrolled in a previous pilot study
revealed substantial familial associations for urinary stones and high
rates of the disease independent of diet or environment.  These previous
findings suggest that there may be an underlying genetic basis for
urinary stones.

The current study will evaluate the DNA from Miniature Schnauzers and
seven other breeds at high risk for developing urinary stones: Yorkshire
Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, Bichon Frises, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Malteses
and Miniature Poodles.  Researchers from the University of Minnesota
hope to identify a chromosome area associated with the disease trait
with the goal of developing a genetic screening test for the disease. 
Results from this study will also help veterinarians select specific
drugs or diets to prevent urinary stones in the breeds most prone".
