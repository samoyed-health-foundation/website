Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by exposure to urine from an
infected animal, usually wildlife. It affects humans and animals
worldwide, causing life-threatening kidney, liver and blood disease.
Although the risk of infection in dogs may have increased in the past
decade, assessing the prevalence of this disease is complicated by a
lack of large scale epidemiologic data, limitations of diagnostic tests,
differences among the various strains of the bacteria, and limited
understanding of the immune response  of infected dogs. This study will
investigate the frequency and distribution  of leptospirosis infection
in dogs throughout the United States and will determine the molecular
characteristics of the different bacteria strains. While the molecular
information will help improve diagnostic tests and vaccines, the
epidemiologic data will help manage the risk and spread of this deadly
disease.
