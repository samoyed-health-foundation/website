Diabetes mellitus affects thousands of dogs every year and can cause
nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy) that may lead to impaired vision,
in particular corneal disease due to decreased corneal sensitivity, tear
production and tear film stability. Blindness resulting from cataracts
is the most common eye complication of canine diabetes, and surgery is
usually performed to restore vision. However, if corneal disease is
present, surgery may not be possible. Also, if cataract surgery is
successfully done and corneal disease develops afterward, it could lead
to loss of or decreased vision. Current treatments have not been proven
to restore corneal sensitivity or tear-film stability in diabetic dogs.

Recently, topical naltrexone, a commercially available opioid
antagonist, was shown to restore corneal sensation, reverse the adverse
tear-film effects of diabetes and improve corneal wound repair in other
species. Researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of naltrexone in
increasing corneal sensitivity, tear production and tear-film break-up
time in diabetic dogs. If proven efficient, topical naltrexone could be
used to improve the quality of vision and decrease suffering due to
corneal disease in diabetic dogs.
