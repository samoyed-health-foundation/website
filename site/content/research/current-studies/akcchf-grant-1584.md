**Project Abstract: **\
 

A torn ligament in the knee, known as cranial cruciate ligament
deficiency (CCLD), is the leading cause of lameness affecting the knees
of large breed dogs. The focus of Dr. Griffon\'s research is to
establish a way to identify individual dogs that are susceptible to this
problem and, ultimately, prevent CCLD. This research group previously
developed a \"CCLD conformation score\" to differentiate limbs of
Labradors with or without CCLD based on their characteristics. They
later found that sound Labradors with a high \"CCLD conformation score\"
displayed stride and body mechanics that could predispose them to CCLD.
They now intend to evaluate the ability of this score to predict CCLD
and explore the genetic origin of the disease in a large pet population.

Purebred Labradors with CCLD and those at low risk for the disease will
be recruited from several practices. Radiographs will be conducted to
calculate the \"CCLD conformation score\" of each limb and and blood
will be collected to compare genes between dogs. We will evaluate the
ability of the \"conformation score\" to correctly identify the status
of each limb and will refine our discriminating ability through the use
of genetic information.  This project will, for the first time, combine
clinical and genetic diagnostic tools to investigate CCLD in a large
population of dogs. These results will help us understand the
relationship between genetics, body characteristics, and CCLD in
Labradors. Ultimately, successful identification of dogs predisposed to
CCLD is the first and crucial step in developing strategies to reduce
the risk or delay the onset of CCLD.
