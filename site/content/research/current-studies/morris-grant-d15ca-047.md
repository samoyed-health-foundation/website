*Summary:*  Researchers will investigate how osteosarcoma  spreads, in
the hopes of finding new treatment targets.

*Description:* Renegade cancer cells escape from virtually every tumor,
but only rare cells from certain tumor types survive, grow and spread
(metastasize) to other parts of the body. In the case of bone cancer,
this metastasis leads to death for virtually every patient. Researchers
do not fully understand how bone cancer cells spread from the primary
site in the bone to the lungs, but recent work suggests that the tumors
send out small bags of cargo (vesicles) and cell fragments into the
bloodstream. These vesicles carry biologically active genes and
proteins, and when they reach the lungs, they prepare and help make this
site welcoming for the renegade tumor cells. Researchers hope to find
markers in the blood circulation that will help them understand why and
how the tumor spreads. Their findings may be used to develop treatments
to help prevent osteosarcoma metastasis in dogs.
