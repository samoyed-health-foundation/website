**Studying the Effect of Cranberry Extract on Canine Urinary Tract
Infections**

Dr. Natasha J. Olby, North Carolina State University, D10CA-022\
Total Study Cost: \$126,130.  SCARF contributed \$3000.  

Thirty-eight percent of dogs develop a urinary tract infection between
the first and sixth week after a spinal cord injury due to a disc
herniation. Cranberries, in the form of extract or juice, are used
widely in humans to reduce the incidence of urinary infections.
Phytochemicals in cranberries reduce the ability of bacteria,
particularly *Escherichia coli*, to adhere to the wall of the bladder,
thus decreasing the chance of developing an infection. Researchers will
determine whether this safe and inexpensive treatment can reduce the
number of infections that dogs develop as they recover from a spinal
cord injury. The results of this study could improve the quality of care
in dogs with spinal cord injuries.
