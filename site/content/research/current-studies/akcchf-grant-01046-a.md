***Project Summary from AKCCHF.org website:***

"To-date our work to understand ezrin's role in cancer spread has been
limited to mouse and human OS. In order that pet dogs benefit from the
development of novel ezrin related therapies and that clinical trials
that include pet dogs can be integrated into the development of new
therapies, it is necessary to confirm our ezrin findings in canine OS
cells. We have made substantial progress in developing and
characterizing canine osteosarcoma cells that we can include in the
study of this aggressive and metastatic bone tumor. The study of
osteosarcoma biology in canine using these cells can now be aligned with
current efforts in our laboratory using murine and human osteosarcoma
cells. The collective outcome of this work will be to improve outcomes
for canine and pediatric OS patients. We have previously studied the
role of ezrin, a cytoskeleton linker protein, in mouse OS cell lines.
These studies have led us to believe that the contribution provided by
ezrin to the metastatic phenotype may be blocked through the use of PKC
inhibitors. Using our newly characterized OS cell lines we have
similarly connected ezrin and PKC signaling in canine OS. These data
begin to pave the way towards therapeutic studies against osteosarcoma
using clinically available PKC inhibitors."
