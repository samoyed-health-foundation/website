**Identification of the Genetic Cause or Causes for Cataracts in Several
Breeds.**

Inherited cataract is a major health problem in dogs, with a significant
frequency in 66 breeds. In some breeds the puppy is born with cataract
(congenital) while in others it develops at six months of age, and in
others at 12-18 months, long after the animal has been placed. 
Thirty-one cataract genes in four breeds (Cockers, Goldens, Labs and
Poodles) were tested.  However, there were no linkages found.
