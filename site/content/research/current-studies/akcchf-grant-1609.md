**Project Abstract: **\
 

Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic
gastrointestinal disease in dogs. Accumulating evidence in human IBD and
animal models suggests that imbalances in composition of the intestinal
microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal
inflammation. Recent studies have also shown that dogs with IBD have
distinctly different duodenal microbial communities compared to healthy
dogs. Current treatments for IBD include the administration of
nonspecific anti-inflammatory drugs which may confer serious side
effects and do not address the underlying basis for disease, namely,
altered microbial composition. Use of probiotics (viable, non-pathogenic
bacteria that exert health benefits beyond basic nutrition) offers an
attractive, physiologic, and non-toxic alternative to shift the balance
to protective species and treat IBD.

The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the clinical,
microbiologic, and anti-inflammatory effects of probiotic VSL\#3 in the
treatment of canine IBD. We hypothesize that VSL\#3 used as an adjunct
to standard therapy (i.e., elimination diet and prednisone) will induce
a beneficial alteration of enteric bacteria leading to induction and
maintenance of remission in dogs with IBD. A randomized, controlled
clinical trial of 8 weeks duration will assess the efficacy of standard
therapy + probiotic versus standard therapy alone. There is a need for
additional data to be generated to provide proof of efficacy in
probiotic therapy before these agents can be applied to widespread
clinical use. These studies will provide highly relevant insight into
the anti-inflammatory effects of probiotics for treatment of human and
canine IBD."
