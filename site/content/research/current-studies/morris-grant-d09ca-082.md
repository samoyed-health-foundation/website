**This study has been discontinued by the researcher due to undesirable
effects on the patient.  SCARF has redirected the funding to
study [D09CA-029](/research/current-studies/morris-grant-d09ca-029).**

Lymphoma is one of the most common and fatal cancers in dogs. Most dogs
treated with chemotherapy go into remission, but the cancer quickly
develops drug resistance and recurs. Chemotherapy generally works by
initiating apoptosis, a normal process in which cells undergo programmed
death. Apoptosis occurs throughout life and is critical for developing
and maintaining healthy tissues, but cancer cells develop ways to avoid
apoptosis, which allows them to grow and survive in an uncontrolled
fashion. Researchers will study a novel compound, PAC-1, that has been
shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells without the presence of
chemotherapy. This study will evaluate the safety, dosing and efficacy
of PAC-1 in dogs with lymphoma.
