The Ostrander Laboratory at the National Human Genome Research Institute at NIH is soliciting donations of blood samples from pure bred dogs for canine health research.  They are working on projects to help reduce the incidence of inherited diseases, and to understand disease patterns across breeds.

The primary goals of the canine genome project are to map and identify genetic markers linked to inherited diseases, and to use this information to improve the overall health of the canine population and to further the understanding of the many complex diseases that arise in the canine genome.

More than 350 inherited diseases have been described across the recognized canine breeds. Often the high frequency of specific diseases within a breed reflects the small number of dogs used to found the breed and/or the subsequent inbreeding within the breed.

We are seeking at least 12 blood samples from unrelated dogs of each breed for inclusion in our studies.  For the purposes of our research dogs are considered unrelated if they do not share any common parents or grandparents.  In addition to a blood sample we ask that you provide the name and sex of the dog, AKC or other registration number, owner contact information, and a signed consent form.

If you would like to participate please contact dog_genome@mail.nih.gov   for information about individual studies and to request a blood collection kit.

All genetic and contact information collected for each dog will remain confidential.  Specifically, your participation in the study, your dog's pedigree, health information you provide, and any data we get from your dog's DNA sample will not be disclosed to any breeders, Club personnel, the AKC, or the AKC Canine Health Foundation.

Our work would not be possible without the participation of responsive owners and club members like you.  For information about the Canine Genome Project in the Ostrander lab and for links to recent publications, please visit our website at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/dog_genome/.

We thank you all for your supporting canine health research!
