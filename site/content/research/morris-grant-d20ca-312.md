Evaluation Imaging Technique for Head and Neck Tumors:

[Update 2020 Progress Report](/files/D20CA312ProgressReport.pdf)
[Update 2022 Final Report](/files/D20CA312FinalReport.pdf)

Knowing how a cancer spreads aids in prognosis and therapy decisions and imaging can help provide valuable data noninvasively. However, current imaging techniques are not very reliable for diagnosing cancer spread to lymph nodes in dogs with head and neck tumors. Researchers will evaluate a novel imaging technique using iron nanoparticles and magnetic resonance imaging as an alternative approach. Identifying a more accurate way of determining if a cancer has spread to local lymph nodes will help guide therapeutic decisions for canine cancer patients. ï»¿
