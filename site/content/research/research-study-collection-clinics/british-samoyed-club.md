# Eye testing


by Hazel Fitzgibbon,

At the British Samoyed Club Championship show in December 2008, eye
testing and subsequent swabs were sponsored by SCARF. As eye testing is
not routinely done by Samoyed owners in the UK and Dr Catherine Mellersh
needed samples at the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket, UK, for the
study into cataracts in Northern Breeds,  SCARF decided that DNA 'on
the ground' would be a way to get material for the study. Fourteen dogs
took part.

**Research Area:** Hereditary Cataract (HC)

**Breeds:** Any breed, but particularly Golden retrievers,  Boston
terriers, Australian shepherds, Large Munsterlanders, Northern (Arctic
breeds), American cocker spaniels

Researchers at the Animal Health Trust require DNA samples from affected
dogs and their close relatives (siblings, parents and grandparents,
affected or unaffected). The DNA can be submitted as a 5ml EDTA blood
sample or as a cheek swab and be accompanied by a 5-generation pedigree
and any relevant health certificates / veterinary diagnoses.
