# SAM To Run Diabetes Clinic


In conjunction with their Annual Heartworm Clinic, the Samoyed Association of Madison has generously volunteered to collect DNA samples from normal Samoyeds for [Dr Hess's study of Diabetes](/research/current-research-studies/akcchf-grant-610). The event was held on Monday evening, March 12, 2007. Wanda Krauss and Bob were coordinating the collection of the DNA blood samples of Sammies 7 years of age or older with Dr Hess.

The SAM club members donated the DNA of 8 older, normal Sammies.

SCARF is very grateful to the club members for their cooperation and assistance in providing normal, healthy, older Samoyeds for our ACKCHF funded grant with Dr Hess.
