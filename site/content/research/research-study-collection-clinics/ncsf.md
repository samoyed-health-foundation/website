# A note from NCSF...


> "NCSF held our annual match on October 14th. In addition to the usual Fall festivities, 13 Samoyeds participated in the University of Pennsylvania study of diabetes mellitus in Samoyeds. Blood was drawn from these healthy dogs, some with diabetic relatives, some without. The blood samples were then sent to the University's Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, Rebecka S. Hess, DVM, Diplomate ACVIM for inclusion. We are to date, the first club and group of Sammy owners/exhibitors to participate in this very important study.

> The purpose of the study is to search for genes associated with increased risk for diabetes in Samoyeds. Early genetic identification of carriers and dogs that are likely to develop diabetes will enable breeders to determine which dogs are not fit for breeding with one another, years before clinical signs of diabetes develop.

> Club President Joan Luna arranged this entire activity just a few days before the match was to be held, having heard about it at the 11th hour. We all stepped forward with Samoyeds of all ages to participate; NCSF is committed to the health of our breed and it is our hope that others will follow soon and volunteer their dogs for this very important study. Special thanks go to SCARF for getting the funding for our techs and vets to draw the blood so we could participate."

SCARF would like to add a public thank you for the generosity of the NCSF members. Dr Hess will have DNA samples necessary to continue with her investigation into the genetic causes of diabetes in our Breed.

With the help of NCSF members, SCARF has recently been able to add 19 non-diabetic Samoyeds to this study. Our goal is 100 normal Samoyeds over 7 years of age, in order for Dr Hess to identify the normal genetic sequence patterns in our Breed. The comparison of normal sequences with the genetic sequence of Samoyeds diagnosed with this illness, will help to identify the abnormal genes in the Samoyed Breed. Once identified, these abnormal breed sequences are where Dr Hess can then focus her attention, to determine, if they are the cause of this genetic disease.
