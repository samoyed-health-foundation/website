From Morris Animal Foundation website:
Understanding the Relationship between Intestinal Bacteria and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common disease of dogs, causing vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss. Some studies suggest that specific intestinal microbiota can drive or exacerbate intestinal inflammation, but this mechanism has not been well studied in dogs. Researchers will assess and track certain bacteria, known to interact directly with the gut immune system, in stool samples of dogs with inflammatory bowel disease. Data will be collected during treatment until the dogs gain remission. Findings will validate if these bacteria are functionally important to the disease process, and how treatment modifies the gut bacteria. This new information will lead to a better understanding of how the gut microbiome can be manipulated in dogs with IBD and may reduce the need to directly biopsy the intestine to establish a definitive diagnosis of this condition.ï»¿
