**What is Posterior Lenticonus?** Posterior Lenticonus is an inherited, congenital lens abnormality which may result in cataract formation in **both** eyes. This type of “cataract” affects both male and female Samoyeds normally between 1 and 3 years of age.

**What is a Cataract?** A cataract is a clouding, or opacity, of the normally clear lens of the eye. Cataracts are classified based on:

- Age of onset (e.g., juvenile)
- Stage of maturation:
  - Incipient (<15% of lens involved)
  - Immature (still see some tapetal reflection through lens)
  - Mature (obscure tapetal reflection)
  - Intumescent (imbibed water and is swollen)
  - Hypermature (liquefaction of lens cortex occurs)
  - Morgagnian (complete liquefaction of lens cortex, leaking of lens protein leaving nucleus ventrally within a shrunken capsule)
- Location within the lens (e.g., anterior/posterior cortical areas of the lens)
- Etiology (e.g, hereditary)
- Associated with other ocular abnormalities (e.g., Posterior lenticonus)
- Retinal Disease (N/A to this discussion)
- Senile (N/A to this discussion)
- Trauma (N/A to this discussion)
- Nutritional (N/A to this discussion)
- Electric shock (N/A to this discussion)
- Radiation (N/A to this discussion)

**The Anatomy of the Lens:** The lens is a transparent, bioconvex structure that is enclosed within a clear sac (the “lens capsule”). The lens capsule consists of anterior and posterior parts that meet in the middle. The lens epithelium is located beneath the anterior lens capsule. Lens cortex apposes the lens epithelium anteriorly (“anterior cortex”) and the lens capsule posteriorly (“posterior cortex”). The nucleus represents the largest component of the lens and is centrally located. Lens sutures represent junctions between the tips of the lens fibers that make up the lens cortex.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Decreased/impaired vision. Also, the pupils, which
normally appear black, may undergo noticeable color changes and appear
to be blue or white.

*In time, the lens protein becomes liquid and may leak through the lens
capsule into the eyes. This will cause cataract-associated intraocular
inflammation (or lens induced uveitis). This inflammation must be
treated with anti-inflammatory drops. If left untreated, complications
such as glaucoma, retinal detachment or the development of intraocular
adhesions will result.*



Causes
------

This lens abnormality is hereditary.

**Pattern of Inheritance.** In the Michigan State University research
study ([AKC Grant No. 1637](/research/current-studies/akcchf-grant-01637))
the data points to an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance,
indicating that affected dogs must receive a gene from each parent.

Dr. Vilma Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, Michigan State University) has stated her
belief that the pattern of inheritance is  **autosomal** (non
sex-linked) **recessive**.

*(Please note: For purposes of the following discussion, the term
"dog" refers to both males and females.)*

**Genetics in General:** The information from which all life develops
is in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). A gene is a portion of a
DNA molecule, carried on a chromosome. Chromosomes occur in pairs (a
pair from each parent).

The dog has 78 chromosomes, in 39 pairs, on which approximately 100,000
genes are located. This makes up the dog's genotype. Each gene in a
chromosome pair has a partner at the same position (or locus) on the
matching chromosome. Each member of a gene pair is called an allele. A
gene has many alleles within a population but an individual animal will
have only 2 alleles that influence a particular trait. If the 2 alleles
are identical, the individual is homozygous at that locus; if the
alleles are different, then heterozygous.

If the allele is dominant, only 1 copy is required to express a trait;
if **recessive** then 2 copies are necessary. *The heterozygote will be
a carrier for that trait -- clinically unaffected but able to pass the
harmful allele to the offspring. The homozygote will be clinically
affected.*

**Autosomal Recessive:** Autosomal recessive is the most common mode of
inheritance for genetic conditions in dogs. To be affected, the animal
must inherit 2 copies of the gene, 1 from each parent. Dogs that are
genotypically normal or dogs that are carriers for a trait will
clinically be normal, but the carrier will pass the affected gene to
approximately half the offspring. As long as carriers are mated to
normal animals, the offspring will be unaffected but some will remain
carriers. If 2 carriers are mated, approximately 25% will be affected,
50% will be carriers and 25% will be normal.

**AA** = normal

**aa** = affected with posterior lenticonus

**Aa** = carrier of gene for posterior lenticonus

As long as the frequency of a gene for a recessive disorder, like
posterior lenticonus, remains low in the population, the particular gene
may be passed along for many generations before by chance 2 carriers are
mated and affected individuals are born. However, the gene frequency may
become unusually high due to breeding of close family members, or
because a sire with a harmful recessive gene is mated frequently because
of desirable traits.

Because the recessive gene is carried in the population in outwardly
normal animals, it is very *difficult* to eradicate this trait. However,
the incidence can be reduced by identification of carriers and affected
dogs and by the conscientious use of this information in breeding
programs. We must all work together -- for the benefit of this breed --
if progress is to be achieved.

Risk Factors
------------

Sire or dam who has posterior lenticonus or carries the gene for it.



Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Ophthalmic examination

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

**Treatment:** The only treatment if cataract development causes vision
loss is surgical removal of the lenses. Eye ointments, pills, special
diets, vitamins or eye exercises will not dissolve or reduce a cataract.

**Candidate Selection:** Any major health problems and ophthalmic
abnormalities should be addressed before cataract surgery is considered.

- A complete physical examination will be performed by your veterinarian, which may include the following preoperative tests:
  - **Blood and urine analysis**;
  - **Chest X-rays**; and
  - **EKG**

- A complete ophthalmic examination should always be performed:
  - **Schirmer tear test** (to test for tear production);
  - **Tonometry** (to check for glaucoma);
  - **Electroretinography** (to check retinal function); and
  - **Ocular ultrasound** (to detect any evidence of retinal detachment).

Depending upon the state of cataract maturation, the experienced
ophthalmologist may still be able to view the fundus; however, an
electroretinagram and ocular ultrasound are the best means to confirm
the absence of any retina disease or detachment. These tests are
mandatory at most hospitals.

Selection of appropriate candidate eyes/animals for lens extraction is
an important consideration for a successful outcome.

**The Surgical Procedure.** Surgical removal of the cataracts is
performed under general anesthesia. A small (2-3mm) incision is made
into the eye. A thick viscoelastic gel is injected into the anterior
chamber to prevent the eye from collapsing during surgery and to protect
the inside of the cornea. A special needle-like ultrasonic instrument is
inserted into the lens. The needle tip vibrates at a very fast rate
(about 40,000 vibrations/second), which ultrasonically fragments and
removes the lens. This procedure is called ***phacoemulsification***.

During surgery the lens is removed from the lens capsule. In most
cataract surgery patients, an intraocular lens ("IOL") is placed inside
the emptied lens capsule to replace the eye's natural lens. The IOL is a
tiny, lightweight, clear, plastic or polyacrylic disc and restores
normal vision to the eye.

In some patients, the lens attachments may be loose or the lens may be
too hard to be broken up by phacoemulsification. In these patients, the
entire lens (including the outer lens capsule) is removed in which case
an IOL cannot routinely (there are lenses that do not require a lens
capsule and may be sutured in the eye with greater risk) be placed
inside the eye. These patients will still see after surgery, but their
vision will not be as well focused as patients with IOL implants.

In the past, cataract surgery was often delayed until the patient was
completely blind. However, cataract surgery is more successful if
surgery is performed sooner, rather than later. First, mature cataracts
are more likely to cause inflammation, which can cause
vision-threatening complications before and after cataract surgery.
Second, the surgery itself is more difficult when the cataract is mature
or has been present for a long time.

Surgery is usually performed on both eyes at the same time.

**"Secondary Cataracts."** Once a cataract is removed, it will not
"regrow." However, in all cataract surgeries, not all of the lens cells
can be removed from within the capsule. Sometimes these lens cells will
attempt to make new lens protein or migrate across the posterior lens
capsule and cause mild cloudiness and wrinkling of the capsule. This is
similar to frost covering a window. This lens protein regrowth usually
occurs within 6 months of surgery performed on young patients (2 years
old or younger). Fortunately, IOL implants usually prevent clouding of
the lens capsule. Sometimes a small hole in the posterior lens capsule
is made when cataract surgery is performed, so that the posterior
capsule cannot become cloudy.

**Preoperative Care:** It is recommended that you train your dog to
wear an E-collar and become used to confinement. Anti-inflammatory and
antibiotic drops are used daily for several weeks before surgery. A few
days before surgery, the drops may be increased.

**Postoperative Care:** Exercise and barking must be restricted for at
least 3-4 weeks after surgery (excessive activity and barking increase
the risk for postoperative retinal detachment and suture breaks). Oral
medications (antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications) are
administered. Eye drops are continued. The patient should wear an
E-collar for about 2-3 weeks after surgery (to prevent any
self-inflicted trauma (e.g., scratching at the eyes)). Post surgical
re-evaluations are generally performed 1-2 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2
weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months following surgery. Periodic
re-examinations every 6 months are recommended (based on patient's
progress).

If you are unable to perform the pre- and postoperative treatments or
return for periodic re-examinations or if your dog will not accept
limited activity or permit you to apply the eye medications, then
surgery is not recommended.

**Success Rates:** 85 to 90% of patients who undergo cataract surgery
regain useful vision. The success rates are better when cataracts are
removed in non-inflamed eyes or in eyes in the early stages of cataract
formation and if you follow all the pre-and postoperative medication
instructions and treatments and return for postoperative
re-examinations.

**Cost**: The cost is expensive, varies by hospital and may not be
covered by insurance.
