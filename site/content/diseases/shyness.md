------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shyness has been said to rank only behind aggression as the most common
behavioral problem in dogs. The shy and insecure dog may be fear-ridden;
afraid of noises and sudden movements. They may find strange people,
strange places and new situations troublesome. Shy dogs are more common
than most people think, but unfortunately many dogs who suffer from this
affliction are never seen by the general public because of their
impairment. There are different degrees of shyness ranging from mild
discomfort to panic resulting in a bite. No matter how vehement their
behavior there are ways of not only managing it, but solving the
problem. While it takes patience, sensitivity and understanding, most
dogs can be helped Most experts agree that, in most cases, shyness is
caused by a combination of the dog\'s genetic predisposition (see
"**Current** **Research**") and a lack of socialization during the early
months of life, with birth to approximately 17 weeks being a critical
time for proper socialization.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Most shy dogs will exhibit several different behaviors.  These behaviors
will fall under one of two defensive drives, which are (1) *flight*, or
(2) *fight*.  Not all signs will be exhibited during the earliest puppy
time periods; real shyness may not appear until the dog is approaching
puberty (5-12 months) or at some point between 12-18 months.

-   Ears going back flat against the head
-   Panting oddly
-   Being reserved around strangers
-   Tucking tail between legs 
-   Refusing to make eye contact
-   Crouching or turning belly-up
-   Urinating/leaking inappropriately (submissive urination)
-   Trying to run away scared
-   Barking madly
-   Hiding (behind furniture, etc.)
-   Having dilated pupils (glassy-eyed)
-   Raising hackles
-   Whining, baring teeth, barking, growling, snapping or biting
-   Having shakes/being nervous
-   If in a crate or pen, trying to plaster body up against back or side
    of crate or pen
-   Being very tense
-   Panicking over simple things like going for a walk or a car ride
-   Having quick reactions to loud noises

Causes
------

**Medical/Physical** - Your first step should always be to consult your
veterinarian to rule out any medical/physical problems that could be
making your dog "appear" to be shy, fearful or nervous.  If your
veterinarian gives your dog a clean bill of health but you still feel
the problem could be medically/physically related, then please seek a
second opinion.  A few medical/physical problems that could be causing
your dog to be shy, fearful or nervous include, but are not limited to:

 

-   painful hips -- hip dysplasia
-   painful spine or neck
-   eye problems/poor eye sight/vision problems
-   an autoimmune disease -- numerous

<!-- -->

-   thyroid problems ^2^
-   deafness

<!-- -->

-   chronic pain
-   epilepsy
-   rage syndrome
-   ear infection
-   rabies ^3^

**Inadequate (lack of) Socialization** -- (thought to be the number one
cause) - If dogs are not properly socialized when they are puppies they
can develop into shy/fearful or nervous dogs.  This can happen with any
type of breeder, in shelters or pet shops.   **Learned behavior** If the
puppies Dam (Mother) is a shy, fearful, timid or nervous dog she may
also pass these traits along to her puppies through their imitation of
her behavior.   **Abuse (rare) or Bad Experience** - especially during
fear stages - Unfortunately, there are humans in this world who have
found many ways to abuse animals.  Adults can be abusers, and children
can inflict some of the cruelest abuse on puppies/dogs.  This is
especially true when the children are not taught and overseen by their
parents or guardians.  Children need to be taught the proper way to
treat animals and how to respect them.  Sometimes a dog may not have
been abused by a human, but rather they were intimidated or had a bad
experience with an older and larger dog. It is a common misconception
that shyness typically results from abuse In fact, this is only rarely
the case. **Genetics (Nature versus Nurture)** - Most research has shown
that genetics are responsible for about half of an animal's or human's
personality with the other half being defined by environmental factors
(most likely causes for shyness per experts).  This can be further shown
by observing a litter that has been well socialized and without known
medical/physical problems or abuse being a factor.  

Risk Factors
------------

-   Separation Anxiety
-   Relinquishing Dog to Shelter or Rescue
-   Shyness in Dam/Sire (genetics)
-   Shyness in Dam (learned behavior)
-   Lack of adequate socialization
-   Being Hit by Vehicle

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

-   Take your dog to your veterinarian to rule out any possible Medical
    causes for your dog\'s shyness.  Please refer to --"Causes" within
    this section.
-   Learn as much as possible about other related issues that may be
    contributing to your dog\'s shyness by speaking with your breeders,
    other breeders/owners, and other veterinarians.  Join email support
    groups/lists, local dog clubs, etc. 
-   Learn what motivates your dog, what distracts your dog, what are
    his/her prey drive (the desire to chase things), pack drive (the
    desire to be in a pack or with a human) and defensive drives (fight
    or flight).  
-   Other Testing - Socialization Testing, etc.

 

Management
----------

There are several things you can do to help your dog overcome his/her
shyness. 

-   It is very important that you do not give your dog attention for
    whining, barking or running off and hiding when strangers approach
    or when people come over to your home.  Ignore these behaviors;
    don\'t try and force your dog into a situation it is not comfortable
    in. 
-   Always praise your dog when it is showing confidence and courage. 
    If your dog is acting fearful or shy in certain situations it is
    important that you act happily and talk to your dog in an upbeat
    tone as if all is well.  If your dog feels you are eased in the
    situation, it will most likely also relax. 
-   Use  a soft tone of voice.   Love, affection and quiet enthusiasm is
    important. 
-   Always let your dog approach a stranger rather than let a stranger
    approach your dog.  Once your dog has approached the person instruct
    them to pet your dog on the chest, NOT the head.  You can also try
    carrying along some food treats to give to people so that once your
    dog approaches them, it is rewarded with a pleasant surprise! 
-   Never physically or verbally reprimand your pup or dog for shy or
    fearful behavior.  You will only make the behavior worse and
    intensify the problem. 
-   No leash corrections of shaking of cans. 
-   Dog Training - look for local dog obedience training schools/classes
    that have been highly recommended for the shy dog by breeders/owners
    you know and trust or local dog club members.  Let the dog behavior
    training instructor(s) know why you want to enroll your dog and what
    goals you hope to accomplish with your dog.

shyness.
