Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) or Dry Eye
===========================================

**Liaison:** Anngharaad \"Annie\" Reid **Email:** <annie.reid@cox.net>



**Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (\"KCS\") **or **Dry Eye** is an eye
disease. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is a latin term. "Kerato" refers to
the cornea or clear covering of the eye. "Conjunctivae" are the moist
pink membranes of the eye socket. "Itis" means inflammation. "Sicca"
means dry. KCS means inflamed, dry cornea and conjunctiva. Generally, it
occurs when there is a deficiency in the water portion of the tear film
which normally accounts for 95% of the tear volume.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Dogs show their discomfort by rubbing their eyes, squinting and being
sensitive to light. Their eyes may become red and inflamed and/or the
cornea may appear dull and dry. There is commonly a thick, mucoid (or
gooey) discharge in the eye or adhered to the eyelashes and hairs around
the eye.

In time (if left untreated), the cornea will undergo destructive changes
in an effort to protect the eye. These changes result in brown
pigmentation, scar tissue growth, ulcer development and blood vessel
growth across the eye. Blindness can result.

Causes
------

-   By far, the most common cause appears to be an immune mediated
    destruction of the tear producing gland tissue. (The cause is
    unknown, but certain breeds, the Samoyed being one, are
    predisposed.)
-   Chronic conjunctivitis (It is recommended that dogs exhibiting
    chronic recurring conjunctivitis be tested for adequate tear
    production to determine if they are suffering from early stages of
    chronic "dry eye.")
-   Infections of the tear glands (e.g., Canine Distemper)
-   Loss of nerve impulses because of long-standing ear infections and
    other nerve disorders
-   Exposure to sulfa containing antibiotics and the NSAID Etogesic
    (etodolac)
-   Anesthesia (temporary). It is a good idea to ask your veterinarian
    to lubricate your Sammy's eyes with ointment prior to surgery.
-   Removal of the nictating membrane (instead of replacement) during
    surgery for Cherry Eye
-   Trauma

Mode of Inheritance
-------------------

The mode is unknown.

Risk Factors
------------

Hypothyroidism

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The "Schirmer Tear Test" (STT) is used to measure tear production. A
measurement of 15mm or more is normal. A measurement of 11-14mm is
borderline. A measurement of less than 10mm is dry. A measurement of
less than 5mm is very dry. Fluorescein stain is used to define possible
breaks in the corneal surface and the rate of the tear break up. Rose
Bengal stain may be used to evaluate the health of the cornea's
epithelium.

Many dogs with STT measurements of less than 10mm may not show clinical
signs of KCS.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

### Non-Surgical Solutions {#non-surgical-solutions style="text-align: justify;"}

There are several objectives in treating "dry eye." These include:

-   [[Tear replacement]{.underline}](#Tear%20replacement)
-   [[Lubrication]{.underline}](#Lubrication)
-   [[Reduce bacterial
    overgrowth]{.underline}](#Reduce%20bacterial%20overgrowth)
-   [[Reduce inflammation]{.underline}](#Reduce%20inflammation)
-   [[Stimulate natural tear
    production]{.underline}](#Stimulate%20natural%20tear%20production:)



**[Tear replacement]{#Tear%20replacement}**

Because the aqueous layer of the tear film is deficient, tear
replacement (artificial tears) is very important but requires an
impractical frequency of administration. **A breakthrough came with the
discovery of cyclosporine topical therapy to control the immune mediated
gland destruction (see below).**

**[Lubrication]{#Lubrication}**

Artificial tears alone do not lubricate as well as natural tears, so the
addition of a lubricant is recommended.

**[Reduce bacterial overgrowth]{#Reduce%20bacterial%20overgrowth}**

The "dry eye" patient frequently has a buildup of mucus in the folds of
the eyelids that is no longer being washed away by tears. This mucus
buildup is food for bacterial growth. An antibiotic and acetylcysteine
are either added to or in combination therapy with the artificial tear
solution to help keep the mucus discharge and bacterial overgrowth under
control.

**[Reduce inflammation]{#Reduce%20inflammation}**

Topical anti-inflammatory drugs are indicated when the flourescein dye
test shows no ulceration. Corticosteroids cannot used when ulcers are
present because they delay healing.

**[Stimulate natural tear
production:]{#Stimulate%20natural%20tear%20production:}**

***Pilocarpine*****:** Patients with nerve loss are treated with
pilocarpine. Pilocarpine is a "cholinergic" drug -- it stimulates the
lacrimal glands to produce tears, but may have undesirable side effects
(diarrhea, drooling, vomiting, drop in heart rate).

***Cyclosporine*****: ** This is the primary treatment for "dry eye"
because of its efficiency at stimulating tear production (dogs with
Schirmer tear tests as low as 2mm still have an 80% chance of responding
to cyclosporine), the need for fewer applications and the lack of
undesirable side effects with long term use.

Cyclosporine is an immunomodulating drug that, when applied as an eye
drop or ointment, suppresses the immune destruction that is the most
common cause of "dry eye" and restores tear production.

*Shering-Plough* developed Optimmune^®^ Ophthalmic Ointment, an eye
ointment containing 0.2% cyclosporine.

***Tacrolimus:***** ** Tacrolimus is one of a group of relatively new
drugs called calcineuron inhibitors. These drugs are anti-inflammatory,
and immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory. At the present time,
tacrolimus is primarily used in the treatment of KCS and immune-mediated
dermatologic diseases. Although cyclosporine has been the standard drug
used to stimulate tear production, topical tacrolimus is thought to be
considerably more effective and as a result may be useful for use in
dogs that are unresponsive to cyclosporine.

### Surgical Solutions {#surgical-solutions style="text-align: justify;"}

**Parotid Duct Transposition **

The parotid duct is the salivary gland on either side of the facial
cheek. It produces saliva which is carried to the mouth via a duct. This
duct can be dissected and moved so to deliver saliva over the eye.
Saliva is a reasonable substitute for tears although, in time, some
mineral deposits will form on the eye surface and eye drops may be
required to control this. The dog's eyes will water when fed and facial
wetting may be undesirable.

**Superficial Keratectomy **

If the surface of the cornea becomes pigmented and interferes with a
dog's vision, the pigmented surface can sometimes be surgically removed.
This procedure is rarely performed unless the primary underlying
condition is well controlled to help prevent recurrence.
