My Samoyed developed a lateral luxating patella (left knee) due to an injury in November of 1994 when he was 11 months old. He was running down the hall and his toenail got caught in the carpet which caused his foot to go in one direction and knee to go in the other. The vet compared this to a common football injury on Astroturf.He cried out in pain and did the typical holding his leg up to put the kneecap back into the socket. I took him into his veterinarian the next day and he was diagnosed with a luxating patella and surgery was scheduled for the next week.Between the vet visit and his surgery, he dislocated the knee cap several times (becoming more frequent as the time for surgery grew closer).

His surgery went well, without complications. He was able to go to Obedience class the 2nd night post-surgery.My vet advised not to give any pain medications as he felt that if he felt too good he would be too active.He never showed any sign of pain except for chewing on the bandage.He actually ate part of his bandage twice (along with removing it) so he was finally put into an Elizabethan collar in order to let the incision heal.

The rest of his convalescence was easy.I was advised that my Samoyed could resume leash walking for 6 weeks.Unfortunately, at the end of the 6 weeks, on the first day of normal activity, he dislocated the kneecap again.Frantic, I rushed him to the vet but the vet was unable to manipulate the knee out of the trochlear groove.He said this might have actually been a “blessing in disguise” as the scar tissue created would hold the kneecap in more firmly. This proved to be true, as he never again had problems with his surgically repaired knee, and competed in flyball and did agility for several years.

One complication that I didn’t see coming was the rapid weight gain with his convalescence. It took years to get the weight off and my advice is to cut down on the food and treats while your dog is on limited activity.

My Samoyed did not ever develop arthritis in his left knee, but developed severe arthritis in his right knee by the time he was 7 years old.His litter brother also dislocated his knees (never had surgery though) which makes me believe there was a congenital weakness in the knee area in his line.

I would recommend the surgery for any young to middle aged dog with this problem.I’d much rather have my dog deal with the surgery than an extended old age with arthritis.Financially, I believe it also makes sense as years of NSAID use is expensive along with the x-rays to diagnose the arthritis.
