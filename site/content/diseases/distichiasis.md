Distichiasis is a disorder where extra eyelashes grow inside the eye
lid.  There is often a second row of eyelashes; this can be a complete
row or just a few lashes. These abnormal lashes tend to fall out and
regrow, just as normal lashes do. Dis*tri*chiasis indicates that there
is more than one lash growing out of a follicle - commonly seen with
distichiasis.


Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Initially your dog might just exhibit eyes which are producing excess
'tears'. He will also squint his eyes a lot. Your dog may then start
to try and rub its' eyes with the paw. This can cause a lot of problems
especially if your dog still has front dew claws; these have been known
to cause corneal scarring and exacerbate the problem. Over time, these
scratches can become infected and may predispose your dog into
developing a corneal ulcer.

Causes
------

This is presumed to be hereditary, but the mode of inheritance has not
been determined

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

A visual examination by a Veterinarian can quickly establish whether
extra eyelashes are present.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.



Unless the eyelashes are very fine and causing no irritation, surgery is
required.  The surgical procedure your veterinarian proposes will be
determined by the number of eyelashes and the state of the lids
themselves. In some severe cases, your veterinarian may refer you to a
veterinary ophthalmologist for treatment.

-   Epilation with forceps ; this sounds technical but just means that
    you pluck the lashes out. This is suitable where there are only one
    or two lashes but they tend to regrow. It is possible for owners to
    do this after instruction.

-   Electroepilation - this is the veterinarian version of electrolysis.
    It has the  advantage of usually being a permanent fix, but may
    cause scarring which deforms the eyelid; it may be necessary to give
    topical antibiotics and steroids post-operatively.

-   Cryotherapy - freezing of the lid margin can be used to prevent hair
    regrowth

-   Eyelid-splitting or wedge resection - this is very extreme and
    causes a lot of eyelid deformation



If the eyelashes have caused corneal ulceration, it is treated with
antibiotics.  The extra lashes should be removed to prevent recurrence.

Management
----------

Distichiasis is a very painful and distressing problem for your dog and
needs prompt treatment. If you imagine having grit in your eye
permanently, this is the same feeling that your dog has with the extra
misplaced lashes.  If not treated, it may lead to corneal ulcers and
infection.
