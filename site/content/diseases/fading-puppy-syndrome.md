Fading Puppy Syndrome is not a specific disease or diagnosis, but a
description of signs that may be due to environmental factors, genetic
causes or infectious agents.  It is used to describe a puppy that
appears normal at birth, but "fades" - fails to grow and thrive during
the first weeks of life.  Sometimes it affects entire litters.

## Signs and Symptoms

Fading Puppy Syndrome usually occurs in neonates (newborns) from birth
to 3 weeks.  Signs include not nursing, crying, and losing weight.  The
puppy may be limp.  Feces may be soft and yellow green if fading is
caused by the canine herpes virus.

## Causes

Although the signs in Fading Puppy Syndrome appear the same, there are
many causes that could be involved.  It is essential to seek early
intervention and diagnosis because puppies worsen quickly and may die
within a day or two.

**Environmental factors** are one of the main causes of death in
neonates.  Poor mothering can cause puppies to develop hypothermia, in
which the body temperature falls precipitously.  Puppies in the first
week of life depend on the mother, or on outside sources such as heat
lamps or whelping room maintained at 85 degrees Fahrenheit, to maintain
sufficient body heat.  In those few days, puppies do not have the
ability to shiver, and their body temperature varies from 95 to 98
degrees Fahrenheit.  By the second and third week, normal body
temperature rises to 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  It is not until the
fourth week that body temperature reaches 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is normal for adult dogs.

In hot climates, or in environments kept too hot for the puppies
comfort, hyperthermia may occur. Puppies may over heat in those
circumstances and cry incessantly.

Dams who have **Caesarean sections** have litters with higher death
rates than litters whelped naturally.  There may be several reasons for
this, one of them being that the maternal instinct is not as strong to
mother the newborns, or factors resulting from the operation itself.

**Environmental toxins** are another cause of Fading Puppy Syndrome.
Bedding materials or substances used to clean or wash the whelping box
may be toxic to newborns.  It may be advisable not to use pine
oils/phenols;or bleach/ammonium based cleaners that come in direct
contact with the puppies. It seems to be preferable to use mild cleaners
with no strong odors that have been thoroughly rinsed before the puppies
are returned to the whelping box.

**Genetics** also plays an important role in neonatal fatalities.
Highly inbred litters, such as those from breedings of siblings, may
have decreased litter size and a high neonatal mortality rate.  Gross
abnormalities are often found in the ill or deceased puppies.  Cleft
palates, atrophy of the thymus and cardiovascular defects are only three
of the problems found in fading puppies.

**Low birth weight** is another factor in fading puppy syndrome.  It can
be associated with transient juvenile hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), a
common cause of fatality especially in toy breeds.  It occurs when
feeding isn't frequent enough to maintain blood sugar levels.  Even if
recognized and treated by feeding frequent small meals, the condition
may persist for several months.

**Infection**, caused by either bacteria or viruses, is often associated
with fading puppy syndrome.  Neonatal septicemia is a systemic bacterial
infection that could be transmitted through the mother or from an
unclean environment.  Viral infections, most frequently canine herpes
virus contracted by the bitch during the last three weeks before birth,
can result in abortion or early neonatal death.  Canine parvovirus 1
(also called CPV-1 or minute virus of canines, MVC) ) is another cause
of fading puppy syndrome. Vaccination of the dam for viral diseases
prior to breeding allows her immunity to carry through to the puppies in
her colostrum.  Unfortunately, vaccines for canine herpes virus and
canine parvovirus 1 are not currently available in the United States.

Finally, **intestinal parasites**, particularly roundworm and hookworms,
which can cross through the placenta, may be a contributing factor in
early puppy death.

## Risk Factors

* Dam's exposure to herpes virus prior to whelping
* Delivery by caesarean section
* Highly inbred litter

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Call your vet immediately if you suspect a puppy is fading.  Specific
treatment will depend on what your vet feels may be causing the
problem.   Supportive care includes keeping affected puppies warm (room
at 85 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit) and preventing dehydration with the use
of an eye dropper to administer fluids such as Esbilac, water and liver
juice.

## Suggested Links

If you experience fading puppy syndrome with a litter please see the
suggested links to be better prepared should it appear with the next
litter.  If a puppy dies, an autopsy to understand the cause can help
define preventive steps for future litters.
