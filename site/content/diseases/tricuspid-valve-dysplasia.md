There are four chambers in a dog's heart, two atria and two ventricles.
Blood returning from the body enters the right atrium and is sent to the
right ventricle.  The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs where
it is oxygenated.  This blood then returns to the heart, to the left
atrium.  The oxygenated blood is sent from the left atrium to the left
ventricle, which pumps it to the rest of the body via the aorta.

There are one-way valves between each atrium and ventricle so that when
the ventricles contract, blood is not forced back into the atria.  The
mitral valve is between the left atrium and ventricle; the tricuspid
valve is between the right atrium and ventricle.

In Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia (TVD), the valve between the right atrium
and ventricle is malformed.   If the valve doesn't function properly,
some blood returns to the right atrium with each heartbeat, less blood
is pumped to the lungs, and less blood is able to return from the body
to the heart.

The severity of the malformation can range from mild to severe.  In mild
cases, the heart may be able to compensate by pumping harder and the dog
may not show any signs of a problem.   In dogs with a more severe valve
malformation, the right side of the heart pumps harder and harder, and
enlarges due to the extra work.  As the valve gets worse, the heart
eventually cannot compensate, and cannot pump enough blood to the body.
With medical treatment these dogs may be able to survive for a while,
but usually die by 3 years.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

-   Possible heart murmur, upper right quadrant of heart
-   Exercise intolerance, lethargy, lack of appetite
-   Pale gums, fainting spells
-   In severe cases, right side congestive heart failure
-   Inability to maintain correct weight



Causes
------

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Congenital (present at birth due to developmental problems or
    genetics.);
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Inheritable in some breeds.
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Cause unknown in Samoyeds at this time.  Not commonly found in
    Samoyeds
    :::

Risk Factors
------------

Parent(s) with disease, if inheritable.  Otherwise unknown at this time.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

1.  Manual Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) by board
    certified cardiologist, followed by
2.  ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Color Doppler echocardiography (type of ultrasound) to definitively
    diagnose the disease
    :::



Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

-   Mild forms, no treatment necessary.
-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Moderate to severe forms, relief of symptoms as necessary
    (diuretics, blood pressure medications for heart failure relief and
    slow heart function),  under the direction of a veterinary
    cardiologist, if possible.
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Nutritional supplementation as necessary to maintain weight.
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Prognosis for mild forms, is good with guarded care.  Whether the
    condition is caused by developmental problems or genetics, the
    offspring of such an animal often have a more severe form of the
    disorder; therefore, it would be unwise to breed an animal diagnosed
    with a mild condition.
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Prognosis for moderate to severe forms, VERY poor.  Usually fatal by
    3 years.
    :::

-   ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    Replacement of valve through surgery has not proven a good option,
    due to success rate and cost in canines.
    :::



Management
----------

From an owner\'s perspective:

The mild form of TVD is self limiting.  Dog should be spayed/neutered to
prevent accidental breeding.  Nutritional advice would be to keep the
dog at optimum weight.  Overweight dogs put a strain on the heart
(already stressed).  Underweight due to nutritional challenges also puts
stress on the heart.  Treat symptoms as they arise and have periodic
(annual) checkups with a cardio vet to assess progression of the
disease.  Allow the dog to self limit his exercise.  No FORCED exercise
(pulling, sledding, jogging, etc.).

Moderate/severe form of TVD has a poor outcome.  Symptoms can be
treated, but dogs with moderate/severe TVD rarely live longer than 3
years of age.
