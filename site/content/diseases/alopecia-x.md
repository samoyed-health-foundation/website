Alopecia X is the name given to a cosmetic condition found primarily in
Nordic breeds of dogs as well as miniature and toy poodles. The primary
symptom of Alopecia X is the loss of coat (alopecia is the medical term
for hair loss). This is actually a hair cycle problem where the normal
shed and growth patterns are disrupted. The dog sheds coat and fails to
re-grow a normal coat. The primary clinical presentation is the
symmetrical, gradual loss of hair over the trunk and thighs, while hair
on the head and front limbs remains normal.  Sometimes the guard hairs
are lost first leaving a soft "puppy" coat. The skin may also darken,
called hyper-pigmentation. Other terms for the condition in veterinary
literature include Adult Onset Growth Hormone Deficiency, Growth
Hormone-Responsive Alopecia, Castration-Responsive Alopecia, and, more
recently, Adrenal Hyperplasia-Like Syndrome.  Breeders of Alaskan
Malamutes often refer to it as Coat Funk and Pomeranian breeders call it
Black Skin Disease.

## Signs and Symptoms

The primary symptom is symmetrical coat loss. It often starts on the
flank and rump near the tail and spreads forward up the sides of the
dog. However, some dogs lose coat around the neck first followed by loss
of coat on the back hind quarters. The coat loss may be gradual and not
noticed by the owner at first. The dog seems to shed normally but the
coat doesn't grow back in some areas. In some instances the outer guard
hairs are lost leaving a fuzzy coat similar to a puppy. Sometimes coat
will grow back at the site of a trauma. For instance, a typical step in
diagnostics is for the veterinarian to do a punch biopsy. A thick tuft
of hair will often grow at the site of the biopsy.

Both sexes are affected and the condition may appear as early as nine
months or as late as ten years old. Both intact and neutered dogs can
have the condition, however neutering will often cause the coat to grow
again at least for one cycle of the coat.  In some breeds the condition
is seen more often in males than in females, however we do not have
enough data to know if there is a difference in Samoyeds.       

## Causes

Alopecia X is a catch-all term that may be describing more than one
disease with similar types of hair loss.  There is no single known
cause.  In some cases it may be a hormone imbalance.   Some cases are
believed to have a genetic link and there is ongoing research to try to
identify the genes involved (see [Current Research](https://www.samoyedhealthfoundation.org/diseases/alopecia-x-current-research/)).

## Risk Factors

Related dogs with the condition (family history)

## Diagnostic Tests

There is no specific diagnostic test for Alopecia X. It is usually a
matter of ruling out other causes of the symptoms. Your veterinarian
will first have to examine the dog for other possible causes of coat
loss such as hypothyroidism, Cushings, Sebaceous Adenitis, parasites or
skin infections.  Thyroid screening, testing for Cushings and sometimes
a punch biopsy may be performed. 

The ACTH response test with measurement of sex hormones and precursors
can be preformed by specialty laboratories such as the University of
Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. However this test is very
expensive and not 100% conclusive, therefore it is not recommended by
many veterinarians - since they consider Alopecia X to be primarily a
cosmetic condition.   

## Treatment Guidelines

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is no treatment that is 100% effective. Castration or spaying is
the first recommendation for intact dogs. This will often cause the coat
to recycle but it is important to understand that it may only recycle
once.

About 30 to 40% of dogs respond to oral melatonin given twice per day.
This is considered a safe treatment but should only be used if a
veterinarian has ruled out other possible causes of hair loss.  It
should not be used in diabetic dogs without consulting a veterinarian as
some adverse reactions have been reported.  As with castration, the coat
may only recycle one time and then symptoms may begin to appear again. 
Some dogs do respond to melatonin with permanent results so that the
coat cycles normally from then on. 

Melatonin is readily available over the counter as a nutritional
supplement.  Nutritional supplements are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration in the same way as drugs, so there may be
variability in potency from brand to brand and bottle to bottle.

Research has been done on treatment with growth hormone and drugs that
alter the adrenal glands' production of cortisol and sex hormones. These
treatments are experimental and have the potential for serious side
effects.

Spontaneous re-growth sometimes occurs with no known cause. This may
happen one year or many years later.

## Management

Dogs with Alopecia X are more susceptible to cold and to sun exposure. 
Consider putting a t-shirt on your dog if it will be in the sun for any
length of time, and some sort of coat if the dog is going to be outside
in the winter and temperatures are low. Exposure to the sun may cause
the skin to darken.

Maintain your dogs remaining coat with a routine of bathing, brushing
and trimming. This will help you to be aware of any secondary skin
infections or changes in the coat, and the stimulation is good for the
health of the skin.  Dogs with Alopecia X often have more flaking of the
skin.
