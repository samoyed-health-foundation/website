width="200" height="188"}Autoimmune  Hypothyroiditis (AH) is the most
common thyroid disease in dogs covering 90% of hypothyroid cases.

Hypothyroid is used to describe the condition that occurs when the
thyroid gland is not incorporating iodine into the hormones T3
(triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). A deficiency of these hormones
may in turn affect many functions throughout the body.

Autoimmune  Hypothyroiditis (AH) is the most common thyroid disease in
dogs covering 90% of hypothyroid cases.

Hypothyroid is used to describe the condition that occurs when the
thyroid gland is not incorporating iodine into the hormones T3
(triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). A deficiency of these hormones
may in turn affect many functions throughout the body.

AH occurs when antibodies in the blood or tissue start to attack the
thyroid gland, thus affecting the amount of T3 and T4 produced. Why they
attack is still the source of mystery, but there is a genetic element
involved in some breeds.  Research is still ongoing in Samoyeds but
researchers suggest that up to 50 breeds of dog may suffer from this
condition.

Some clinicians assert that the phrase hypothyroidism should be given to
the end stages of the disease, as a dog can have AH and not exhibit
clinical signs for a long time.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Actual signs of the disease don't start to appear until more than 75% of
the Thyroid gland has been destroyed by antibodies. Signs are typically
first seen at 2-5 years of age.

Because the thyroid is an important master gland, if it doesn't work, it
can affect multiple organs, from the skin to fertility. See Jean Dodd's
paper referenced below for a comprehensive list.

Classic signs are alopecia, greasy regrowth of hair especially on the
body and the 'rat tail'; lethargy, easy weight gain, not liking
exercise. Also slow heart rate and sometimes severe neurological signs
occur, with ataxia, circling and unusually for Samoyeds, aggression.
Infertility in males and females may occur.

Causes
------



[]{#_msocom_1}

Most affected breeds are now thought to have a genetic component.  It
appears to be polygenic (has a number of different genes involved).

It has been suggested that nutrition and toxins may trigger a
genetically susceptible animal.

Risk Factors
------------

Related dogs with disorder.

Exposure to some toxins in genetically susceptible animal.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

If hypothyroidism is suspected, a dog should have a medical history
taken, a complete physical, and blood tests.

**Note**:  Recent vaccinations, especially rabies^7^, or testing a bitch
during estrus^8^ can interfere with test results.

Several blood tests are available for diagnosing hypothyroidism and AH.
Testing has improved over the last few years. T4 and TSH levels used to
be the only ones available for diagnosis. It is suggested that any dogs
that have only had these tests and been declared clear be tested under
the newer protocols.

-   T4 -- The total amount of the main circulating thyroid hormone in
    serum.
-   Free T4 (FT4) -- T4 that is not bound to serum proteins.  This is
    the form of T4 that is available to enter cells.
-   TSH  - Thyroid stimulating hormone; this does as it says and pushes
    the thyroid to produce T3 and T4. If the levels are elevated it
    means that not enough T3 and T4 are being produced.
-   TgAA - Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies: This last test is particularly
    revealing as these are the antibodies that destroy the thyroid.

The results of the testing depend on the cause and the progression of
the disease.  For T4, what is considered "normal" can also be
breed-specific.  The normal range for Samoyeds is currently under
investigation.

The first 3 tests can determine if the dog is functionally hypothyroid,
but do not indicate if the dog has the autoimmune version.  That can
only be determined with the TgAA test.

If the thyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAA) levels are elevated but the T4
levels still relatively normal it means that AH is confirmed but there
is still enough functioning thyroid to produce the T4 and FT4.  It is
even possible that the affected dog has no symptoms.  These tests should
be repeated as the dog gets older. At that time, the TgAA may go back
down, when there is no thyroid left for the antibodies to attack, but T4
may be low.

Interpreting these test results is a slippery slope and it is worthwhile
to seek consultation with a Vet with experience in Endocrinology, as
this needs to be carefully monitored. This is a complicated disorder and
even with the best will in the world, misdiagnosing or incorrect dosing
could prematurely ruin what is left of your pet's thyroid system.

There are other things that can cause abnormal thyroid test results. For
instance, there is a condition called compensatory hypothyroidism, or
sick euthyroid syndrome (SES) which can be caused by a number of
clinical conditions including trauma, stress, injury, illness, poor
diet.^10^  Serum total T4, free T4, and total T3 concentrations may be
low (ie, in the hypothyroid range), but the TSH is usually normal.^11^
The difference between SES and true hypothyroidism is that once the
stressor is removed (ie illness, injury etc.), the thyroid gland returns
to normal function^11^.

The T4 alone can be decreased for various reasons; toxins are one, but
more likely is an adverse effect of medication. The following
medications all can affect thyroid test results:

-   Glucocorticoids: high dosages, chronic therapy: T4 falls, FT4 more
    resistant, TSH is unchanged or decreased.
-   Sulfonamides: chronic therapy may cause reversible hypothyroidism
    and low T4
-   Phenobarbital: chronic therapy - mild fall in T4 and FT4; TSH
    remains normal in most dogs, but rises in a small percentage.
-   Carprofen: mild fall inT4, FT4 normal
-   Clomipramine: mild fall in T4 and FT4; TSH remains normal

It is important that current medication be taken into consideration when
any dog is being diagnosed for any disorder, but thyroid levels seem to
be very prone to deviation.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is very good medication available which can control the disorder
for many years.

Levothyroxine, a synthetic form of T4 sold as Soloxine or Synthroid, is
the drug of choice for most clinicians; it is given once or twice a day
and dosage is dependent on the weight of the dog. Another T4 test should
be done after a fortnight to check that the correct dosage is being
given.  T4 and FT4 should also be rechecked at least once a year.  The
timing of when the blood sample is taken vs when the medication is given
can be critical to accurate results, so check with your veterinarian.

Where the affected animal has shown clinical obesity on diagnosis,
weight should start to drop off as a result of medication. He or she
should be reweighed regularly to make sure you are not overdosing.

Management
----------

According to the OFA and numerous published reports, autoimmune
hypothyroiditis (AH) is a heritable condition.  The TgAA assay is
recommended to screen dogs who will be used for breeding because this
assay can detect the disease before any clinical symptoms occur^4^.  The
best age for testing for TgAA is between ages 2 and 6.
