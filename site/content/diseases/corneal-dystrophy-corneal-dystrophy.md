One day I noticed a greater than normal discharge from one of my dogs' eyes. Her vet examined her eyes and saw some cloudiness in the corneas which he diagnosed as corneal dystrophy. He did a fluorescein dye test of the eye with the discharge, but found no ulcer. He prescribed eyedrops to reduce the inflammation which was causing the discharge.

Sometime later I again saw greater than normal discharge. This time there was an ulcer, so our vet stopped the anti-inflammatory eyedrops and gave her antibiotic eyedrops instead. That turned out not to be enough. The ulcer was so severe that it required surgery; her eyelid was sewn shut to promote healing. During healing, without the anti-inflammatory drops, there was excessive growth of blood vessels that could be seen on the cornea when her eye was exposed again (vascularization). As soon as the ulcer was healed we had to go back to the anti-inflammatory drops. Our vet sent us to a veterinary ophthalmologist who confirmed his diagnosis of corneal dystrophy. We could see the cloudiness in her corneas.

This became a chronic condition requiring daily eyedrops and frequent trips to the vet any time we saw the slightest abnormal discharge so that he could do the fluorescein test and determine if there was an ulcer this time or not. We were able to manage it with eyedrops of one sort or another as long as we were very observant and went to the vet immediately when there was any change.
