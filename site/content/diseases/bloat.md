Bloat
=====

**Bloat** (gastric dilation) occurs when fluid or ingesta accumulate in
the stomach and are unable to escape due to a mechanical or functional
obstruction of the gastroesophageal and pyloric openings. Bloat may
occur with or without twisting (volvulus) of the stomach. When bloat is
accompanied by twisting, it is a life threatening emergency.
