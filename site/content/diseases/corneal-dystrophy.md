Corneal Dystrophy
=================

<div>

Corneal dystrophy is an opacity in the cornea (clear covering of the
eye).  In Samoyeds it is typically in both eyes with lipid deposits in
the \"stromal\" layer of the cornea. It is suspected to be an inherited
disorder.  Corneal dystrophies may also occur in the epithelial or
endothelial layers of the cornea.

 

 

The term corneal dystrophy is sometimes used to describe a similar
disorder, corneal degeneration. This also is an opacity in the cornea,
but is not inherited, may only be in one eye, and may be accompanied by
inflammation. The opacity is caused by deposits of lipid, cholesterol or
calcium.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Corneal dystrophy and degeneration are seen as opaque areas in the
normally clear cornea. The age of onset of corneal dystrophy in Samoyeds
is typically between 6 months and 2 years.

 

Causes
------

Corneal dystrophies are suspected to be inherited in Samoyeds and some
other breeds. Corneal degeneration is secondary to injury or other eye
disorders, or to systemic disorders such as high cholesterol or calcium
levels. These can cause deposits of lipid or calcium in the cornea.

 

Risk Factors
------------

Corneal dystrophies: Related dogs with the disorder.

 

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Corneal dystrophy and degeneration are evaluated by visual observation
of the surface of the eye with a bright light. If an associated corneal
ulcer is suspected, a fluorescein dye test may be performed. The
yellow-green dye is applied to the eye; ulcerated regions retain the dye
and look bright green.

 

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Most stromal dystrophies, the type typically seen in Samoyeds, do not
cause discomfort or interfere with vision; treatment is usually not
required. If complications such as erosions/ulcers develop, a
veterinarian can prescribe antibiotic drops/ointment. Endothelial
dystrophies often lead to fluid buildup (edema) in the cornea with
inflammation, reduced vision and corneal ulcers. Treatment is
symptomatic. Edema can be treated with a high-salt ointment
(hyperosmotic); ulcers can be treated with antibiotic drops/ointment.
Treatment of corneal degeneration depends on the cause, if determined,
and the specific symptoms. Various types of eye drops or ointments may
be used to reduce inflammation, lessen calcium deposits or treat
associated ulcers. Rarely, surgery is recommended to replace part of the
cornea (graft), but this procedure does not work as well in dogs as in
humans.

 

Management
----------

Keep a lookout for discomfort or any excessive discharge from the eyes,
and see your veterinarian or a veterinary ophthalmologist. Because
corneal dystrophy is suspected to be an inherited disorder, affected
dogs should not be bred; their close relatives should probably not be
bred either. Samoyeds used for breeding should be examined each year by
a board certified Veterinary ophthalmologist. If free from heritable eye
disease they may be certified by the OFA  Eye Certification Registry. 
The
[certification](http://www.offa.org/eye_regproc.html){.external-link} is
only valid for 12 months, then the dog must be reexamined to be
recertified.
