Thank you to Tina Oswald for putting together this article for SCARF.

* Lymphosarcoma (LSA) is caused by a cancerous proliferation of
  lymphocytes (cells that normally function in the immune system) and
  is the third most common cancer in dogs.  A lymphocyte is a type of
  white blood cell which develops in lymph nodes and other lymphoid
  tissues such as the  spleen, thymus, gastrointestinal tract, and
  bone marrow.  When abnormal lymphocyte proliferation occurs in one
  or more tissues it is called lymphosarcoma (if confined to the bone
  marrow it is called leukemia).
* LSA is further broken down into B-Cell or T-Cell Lymphosarcoma.
  B-cells and T-cells are specific types of lymphocytes.  Most dogs
  have B-cell LSA and of the two, it's easier to treat.  *Note: Easy
  way to remember is "B" is for "Better" and "T" is for "Terrible"*
* Most dogs diagnosed with LSA are between the ages of 6-9 years.

## Signs and Symptoms

Clinical signs may be present depending on where the LSA is.  For
example in LSA affecting the gastrointestinal tract, the dog may present
with diarrhea or vomiting.

There are 5 Stages of Lymphosarcoma

* Stage I:  Enlargement of ONE lymph node - usually under the jaw.
  This is not painful and can go undetected by the owner.  It is
  rarely diagnosed at this stage.
* Stage II: Enlargement of more than one lymph node in one region of
  the body
* Stage III: Multiple lymph nodes enlarged throughout the body.

  * *Note*: *Stage IIIA is usually the earliest at which LSA is detected.*
* Stage IV: Spleen and/or Liver involved
* Stage V: Bone  marrow or other organs involved (e.g.
  gastrointestinal tract, skin, nervous system)

There are also subclasses A and B  to the stages

* A -- shows no signs of illness
* B - indicates clinical signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, fluid in
  the lungs

## Causes

The cause of Lymphosarcoma is not known.

## Risk Factors

Although the cause and genetics of lymphosarcoma are not known, it is
thought to 'run in families' in some breeds.

## Diagnostic Tests

A basic diagnosis of lymphoma can often be achieved through aspiration
of an affected lymph node and cytology (evaluation of cells from the
lymph node aspirate).  Additional tests are performed to determine the
overall health of the dog and the stage of the disease, and to further
refine the diagnosis:

* CBC (Complete Blood Chemistry) test -Increased serum calcium is
  associated with a poorer outcome
* Thoracic radiographs (x-rays of chest area)
* Abdominal ultrasound
* Bone marrow aspiration and examination
* Immunophenotype (to differentiate B cell vs T cell LSA)
* Biopsy of spleen and/or liver
* *Note: If emergency
  splenectomy is preformed, a small sample should be sent out for
  pathology.*

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

LSA can be treated, but is not considered curable.  The goal of
treatment is to extend life via remission of the disease.

* Prednisone Only -- 1-2 months survival time
* Radiation
* Chemotherapy - (Standard treatment for most patients). There are a few different "Protocols" that are used for Lymphosarcoma.  Each uses multiple drugs, with one or more drugs  given weekly.  Some are injectable drugs and/or given orally.

  1. VELCAP Protocol from TUFT University - combines 5 drugs:  Vincristine, Cytoxan, Prednisone, Adriamycin, and L-asparaginase
  2. Madison (U of Wisconsin) Protocol - Combines 5 drugs (same drugs as VELCAP but with different dosing regimen):  L-asparaginase, Vincristine, Cytoxan, Adriamycin & Prednisone.  Another Wisconsin protocol, L-VCA short, uses only 4 of the drugs, Vincristine, Cytoxan, Adriamycin & Prednisone.
  3. COP Protocol -- Combines 3 drugs:  Vincristine, Cytoxan and Prednisone

*Dogs usually do not have the extreme side effects with Chemotherapy
that humans do.  That is not to say there aren't any, such as nausea and
occasional diarrhea. Some owners notice the dog losing its whiskers.*

## Management

* Some research has shown that high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets may be
  good for cancer patients.  Cancer cells use simple carbohydrates
  such as glucose for energy, and some have difficulty utilizing fat,
  so you may favor normal cells, while providing extra energy to your
  dog, by feeding a diet rich in a high-quality fat sources and low in
  carbohydrates. The type of fat may also be important -- n-3
  polyunsaturated fatty acids such as are found in fish oils being
  recommended.
* In general, if you feed your cancer dog store-bought food, look for
  one that is low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein content.
  You can add the fatty acids to meals in the form of fish oil, flax
  seed oil and many other oils found in most health food stores.
* The only commercially produced dog food that has been scientifically
  studied for its effect on dogs with cancer is Hill's Prescription
  Diet Canine n/d. This dog food was found to appreciably prolong the
  lives of dogs with lymphoma. It was not tested on dogs with other
  types of cancer.
