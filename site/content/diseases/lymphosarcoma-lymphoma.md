-   Lymphosarcoma (LSA) is caused by a cancerous proliferation of
    lymphocytes (cells that normally function in the immune system) and
    is the third most common cancer in dogs.  A lymphocyte is a type of
    white blood cell which develops in lymph nodes and other lymphoid
    tissues such as the  spleen, thymus, gastrointestinal tract, and
    bone marrow.  When abnormal lymphocyte proliferation occurs in one
    or more tissues it is called lymphosarcoma (if confined to the bone
    marrow it is called leukemia).
-   LSA is further broken down into B-Cell or T-Cell Lymphosarcoma.
    B-cells and T-cells are specific types of lymphocytes.  Most dogs
    have B-cell LSA and of the two, it's easier to treat.  *Note: Easy
    way to remember is "B" is for "Better" and "T" is for "Terrible"*
-   Most dogs diagnosed with LSA are between the ages of 6-9 years.

Disorder](lymphosarcoma-lymphoma/addliving_form.html)** journal entry?

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Clinical signs may be present depending on where the LSA is.  For
example in LSA affecting the gastrointestinal tract, the dog may present
with diarrhea or vomiting.

There are 5 Stages of Lymphosarcoma

-   Stage I:  Enlargement of ONE lymph node - usually under the jaw.
    This is not painful and can go undetected by the owner.  It is
    rarely diagnosed at this stage.
-   Stage II: Enlargement of more than one lymph node in one region of
    the body
-   Stage III: Multiple lymph nodes enlarged throughout the
    body.   *Note*: *Stage IIIA is usually the earliest at which LSA is
    detected.*
-   Stage IV: Spleen and/or Liver involved
-   Stage V: Bone  marrow or other organs involved (e.g.
    gastrointestinal tract, skin, nervous system)

There are also subclasses A and B  to the stages

-   A -- shows no signs of illness
-   B - indicates clinical signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, fluid in
    the lungs

Causes
------

The cause of Lymphosarcoma is not known.**  **

Risk Factors
------------

Although the cause and genetics of lymphosarcoma are not known, it is
thought to 'run in families' in some breeds.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

A basic diagnosis of lymphoma can often be achieved through aspiration
of an affected lymph node and cytology (evaluation of cells from the
lymph node aspirate).  Additional tests are performed to determine the
overall health of the dog and the stage of the disease, and to further
refine the diagnosis:

-   CBC (Complete Blood Chemistry) test -Increased serum calcium is
    associated with a poorer outcome
-   Thoracic radiographs (x-rays of chest area)
-   Abdominal ultrasound
-   Bone marrow aspiration and examination
-   Immunophenotype (to differentiate B cell vs T cell LSA)
-   Biopsy of spleen and/or liver         *Note: If emergency
    splenectomy is preformed, a small sample should be sent out for
    pathology.*

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

LSA can be treated, but is not considered curable.  The goal of
treatment is to extend life via remission of the disease.

    Chemotherapy - (Standard treatment for most patients). There are a
    few different "Protocols" that are used for Lymphosarcoma.  Each
    uses multiple drugs, with one or more drugs  given weekly.  Some are
    injectable drugs and/or given orally.
    :::

1.  ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    VELCAP Protocol from TUFT University - combines 5
    drugs:  Vincristine, Cytoxan, Prednisone, Adriamycin, and
    L-asparaginase
    :::

2.  Madison (U of Wisconsin) Protocol - Combines 5 drugs (same drugs as
    VELCAP but with different dosing regimen):  L-asparaginase,
    Vincristine, Cytoxan, Adriamycin & Prednisone.  Another Wisconsin
    protocol, L-VCA short, uses only 4 of the drugs, Vincristine,
    Cytoxan, Adriamycin & Prednisone.
3.  ::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
    COP Protocol -- Combines 3 drugs:  Vincristine, Cytoxan and

*Dogs usually do not have the extreme side effects with Chemotherapy
that humans do.  That is not to say there aren't any, such as nausea and
occasional diarrhea. Some owners notice the dog losing its whiskers.*

Management
----------

-   Some research has shown that high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets may be
    good for cancer patients.  Cancer cells use simple carbohydrates
    such as glucose for energy, and some have difficulty utilizing fat,
    so you may favor normal cells, while providing extra energy to your
    dog, by feeding a diet rich in a high-quality fat sources and low in
    carbohydrates. The type of fat may also be important -- n-3
    polyunsaturated fatty acids such as are found in fish oils being
    recommended.
-   In general, if you feed your cancer dog store-bought food, look for
    one that is low in carbohydrates and moderate in protein content.
    You can add the fatty acids to meals in the form of fish oil, flax
    seed oil and many other oils found in most health food stores.
-   The only commercially produced dog food that has been scientifically
    studied for its effect on dogs with cancer is Hill\'s Prescription
    Diet Canine n/d. This dog food was found to appreciably prolong the
    lives of dogs with lymphoma. It was not tested on dogs with other
    types of cancer.
