**Retinal dysplasia:** The term dysplasia means a defective development
of an organ or structure.  Merck, CERF and the Diplomates of the
American College of Veterinary Ophthalmology explain it as follows: "it
is a nonprogressive, abnormal development of the retina that is present
at birth. It occurs when the 2 primitive layers of the retina do not
form together properly.  The disorder can be inherited or it can be
caused by a prenatal infection (e.g. herpes virus or parvovirus)".

There are 3 types:

1.       Focal or multifocal retinal dysplasia: folds or small rosettes,
single or multiple, may become less evident with maturity  (vision
impairment is unknown, but blinds spots can occur)

2.        Geographic retinal dysplasia: irregularly shaped areas of the
retinal tissue that appear similar to a horseshoe in shape.  These
lesions can change in appearance with age.  These lesions can co-exist
with folds or rosettes.  As the folds may disappear later when the
retinas mature, this type of dysplasia will persist.  (some degree of
visual impairment and possibly blindness)

3.        Complete retinal dysplasia with detachment: most severe, often
leads to blindness and secondary problems such as glaucoma, has been
linked to skeletal defects in the Labrador Retriever and the Samoyed.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

There are no outward symptoms of the eye but signs that the puppy/dog is
having difficulty seeing would include frequently bumping into objects,
less activity, and possibly timid or fearful.  An eye examination by an
ophthalmologist should be performed.

Causes
------

The cause of retinal dysplasia in most dogs is genetic in origin and a
congenital disease.  Others causes include viral infections, vitamin A
deficiency, x-ray radiation, certain drugs, and intrauterine trauma. 
Simple autosomal recessive inheritance has been suspected in Akitas,
American Cocker Spaniels, Australian Shepherds, Bedlington Terriers,
Beagles, Dobermans, English Springer Spaniels, Labradors, Rottweilers,
Old English Sheepdogs, Sealyham Terriers, and Yorkshire Terriers. In
many breeds ophthalmologists and researchers have not determined exactly
how retinal dysplasia is passed. In the Labrador retriever and Samoyed
breeds, a combination of retinal dysplasia and skeletal defects
(dwarfism) has been described.

 

Risk Factors
------------

-   toxicity (something in the envivorment that the bitch may be exposed
    to during pregnancy or the newborn is exposed to)
-   infection during pregnacy (e.g herpes virus and possibly parvovirus)
-   a trauma at a very young age
-   inherited the genetic make up for RD

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Retinal dysplasia can be detected as early as 6-8 weeks during a CERF
examination. However, because the size of the eye is small and young
puppies are often wiggling during examination, a re-examination is
recommended 6 months later in order for the ophthalmologist to better
see the back of the eye is recommended.

7/25/2008 - Optigen now has a DNA test available for the gene mutation
that causes inherited Retinal Dysplasia/OculoSkeletal Dysplasia (OSD,
ie.,dwarfism) in the Samoyed and Labrador Retriever.  For more

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

 

-   There is no treatment for retinal dysplasia. 
-   The affected animal should not be used in a breeding program.
-   Annual eye checks with an ophthalmologist
