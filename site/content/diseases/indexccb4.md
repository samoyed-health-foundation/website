disorders, syndromes and conditions\... {#disorders-syndromes-and-conditions... .documentFirstHeading}
=======================================

As in humans, the Samoyed has some intermittently diagnosed diseases and
many diseases in a very small percentage of the population that are
present, but not significant in the population.

The information provided in the disorder/syndrome/conditions section has
been collected by volunteers. These volunteers may or may not have a
scientific background, but they all share a love of dogs. These topics
are provided to you as a starting point for your search for information
on a particular disease (s). To help you in your search, the references
and suggested links have been
[rated](ratings-what-do-they-mean.html "ratings...what do they mean?")
in this area of the website where appropriate.  This section is not
intended to diagnose or treat an illness, but rather as a general
overview for you to begin your investigation.

**Note**:  A limited number of disorder descriptions are available at
this time, but more will be added shortly.  Click on the A to Z link
below to see how the articles will be presented. SCARF is in the process
of having more  topics reviewed so that they may be uploaded to the
website.  Please check back soon.

If you would like to add a journal entry about your dog\'s experience
with a disease, you may do so by clicking
