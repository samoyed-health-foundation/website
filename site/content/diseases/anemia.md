Anemia

Anemia is a decrease in the number of erythrocytes or red blood cells
(RBCs) circulating in the blood stream. It is not a disease in and of
itself but, rather, is a symptom of a number of diseases. Regenerative
anemia can occur while RBCs are still being produced, as a result of
loss (bleeding) or increased destruction.  Nonregenerative anemia   is
due to a lack of production of RBCs.  Anemia is also classified as
either acute (sudden and rapid) or chronic (slow and long standing).

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Acute anemia can result in shock and even death if the  blood volume is
not replaced rapidly. Signs include rapid heart rate, pale gums,
bounding or weak pulse, and low blood pressure. Chronic anemia is more
subtle. Common signs and symptoms include easy tiring or panting and
rapid heart rate in the absence of strenuous exercise, pale gums,
depressed mood and energy level or even lethargy, and decrease in
appetite. Jaundice (yellow whites of the eyes) or bruising may be
present in certain conditions.

Causes
------

**Causes of regenerative anemia:**

Blood loss: external or internal bleeding resulting from injury,
parasites, or  from rupture of a splenic tumor or other neoplasm.  

Hemolysis (break down of red blood cells): Immune-mediated hemolytic
anemia ([IMHA: see separate
discussion](immune-mediated-hemolytic-anemia.html "Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia"){.internal-link}),
other immune-related hemolysis, metabolic causes, toxins, infections,
and certain inherited diseases.

 

**Causes of nonregenerative anemia:**

Underproduction of blood cells: nutritional deficiencies, anemia of
chronic disease, renal disease, primary bone marrow disease.

Risk Factors
------------

Risk factors for anemia are the risk factors of the various underlying
processes that produce the anemia.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

-   Medical History.

-   Hematocrit or Packed Cell Volume (PCV) - a quick test for
    determining what percent of blood is RBCs.

-   CBC with platelet and reticulocyte count (young RBCs)  - Can detect
    anemia and may give information about the possible cause.

-   Depending on the results of these tests your vet may then obtain any
    of a number of special studies including perhaps: blood chemistry or
    other special blood tests, urinalysis, examination of stool for
    blood or parasites, xrays, or bone marrow biopsy.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

The treatment of anemia is the treatment of the underlying causative
condition. If anemia is severe and/or rapid in onset, blood transfusion
may be necessary.

--------------

Anemia is a symptom; appropriate support groups would relate to the
underlying cause of the anemia.
