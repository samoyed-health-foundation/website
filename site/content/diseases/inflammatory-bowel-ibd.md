Thank you to Joan Martin for putting together this article for SCARF.

Broadly defined, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) refers to a diverse
group of intestinal disorders involving chronic inflammation in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, stomach, small intestine (duodenum,
jejunum, ileum) and/or large intestine (colon).  More narrowly defined,
IBD is a chronic condition of the gut involving inflammatory cell
infiltrates that cannot be attributed solely to cancer, allergies,
bacterial or parasitic infections.

IBD is a chronic, abnormal concentration of inflammatory cells in the mucosa or lining of the stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and/or large intestine (colon).   The inflammation cannot be attributed solely to cancer, allergies, bacterial or parasitic infections.

Classification of IBD is based on the type inflammatory cell involved:

- Lymphocytes and plasmacytes:  lymphoplasmacytic enteritis or IBD.  In this type, plasma proteins may be lost into the gastrointestinal tract (protein-losing-enteropathy (PLE)).  In severe cases nutrient absorption and gut motility can be compromised.
- Eosinophils:  eosinophilic IBD
- Neutrophils:  suppurative or neutrophilic IBD

In advanced cases, normal tissue may be replaced by fibrous or granulomatous (scar-like) tissue.  Severity is believed to reflect the degree to which inflammatory cells have infiltrated the gut lining.

**Note:**  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is sometimes confused with IBD but is a completely diffferent condition:   stress-related diarrhea.  Treatment is aimed at reducing the stress.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

General symptoms of IBD include diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss, all
of which may occur intermittently. Common signs depend on the location
and severity of the inflammation:

-   Stomach and upper small intestine - chronic vomiting and weight
    loss;

-   Jejunum, ileum and colon - chronic diarrhea, weight loss and
    infrequent vomiting;

-   Small bowel - diarrhea and large volume of feces;

-   Large bowel - diarrhea, straining, some blood and mucous in small
    volume feces accompanied by frequent attempts to defecate.

Causes
------

IBD is a sensitization of the GI tract and overreaction of the immune
system to a factor that would not normally cause such an extreme
response.  The cause is unknown but possible factors include food
allergy, food intolerances, parasites, allergies, chronic intestinal
infections with bacteria, fungi, or protozoa, and intestinal bacteria
overgrowth.  In the Shar-pei IBD is thought to result from food allergy
coupled with an immunoglobulin A insufficiency.

Risk Factors
------------

Some breeds are more at risk (e.g. Shar-peis, Basenjis).  Samoyeds are
not a breed at high risk.  IBD usually affects younger to middle aged
dogs (mean age 6.3 yr), either gender.  In Basenjis  lymphocytic
plasmacytic IBD is inherited by an unknown mechanism.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

IBD diagnosis is one of exclusion.  Systemic diseases, diseases of other
organs, chronic parasitism (e.g. giardia), food allergies, infectious
diseases and alimentary lymphosarcoma/lymphoma (cancer) need to be ruled
out, because treatments used for IBD can mask other problems, such as
cancer.  Blood tests, urinalysis and fecal examination can be done as a
first step.  Food allergies, parasites and bacterial
infections/overgrowth can each be addressed and eliminated by dietary
therapy, broad spectrum deworming and antibiotics, respectively.
Abdominal ultrasound can be used to assess thickening, architectural
disruption and infiltration of the mucosal lining and enlargement of
lymph nodes, giving an indication of the severity and extent of IBD.
Ultrasound interpretation requires a veterinary specialist and is
non-invasive.  While not definitive, a blood test for several IBD
markers can be useful.      The only definitive test for IBD is a biopsy
of the gut lining.  This procedure requires a veterinary specialist to
do an endoscopy, colonoscopy or surgery.  It is expensive and invasive.
Calculation of a canine disease activity index (CDAI) from analysis of
biopsied tissues (using measures of architectural distortion, glandular
necrosis or loss/hyperplasia, ulceration, villus atrophy and fibrosis of
lamina propria in the mucosal lining of the gut) has been proposed to
identify IBD and classify it as mild, moderate or severe.  In addition
biopsy can distinguish IBD from Intestinal Lymphangiectasia, a disorder
in which the lymph vessels supplying the lining of the small intestine
become enlarged and obstructed.  Endoscopic exfoliation cytology
(examination of cells brushed/scraped from the inner surface of the
intestine) in conjunction with biopsy may be useful.

Treatment Guidelines

> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment

IBD is controlled, not cured.  Anti-inflammatory
therapy/immunosuppressive drugs in conjunction with dietary therapy may
be successful for control. Unfortunately, the drugs used can have
serious side effects.  Additional treatments to consider are the use of
agents that protect the lining of the gut and/or that reduce intestinal
motility.

Management
----------

Keeping a log of  signs and symptoms is useful both for the owner and
the vet. Dietary therapy involves the dietary history of the dog and
considerations are a consistent diet, a novel (new to that dog)
carbohydrate and a novel single highly digestible protein source.
Alteration of fiber content and increasing the ratio of enriched n3/n6
polyunsaturated fats may be of benefit as may hypoallergenic diets.
Controlled diet tests require 6-8 weeks to assess results.  Dietary and
pharmacologic therapy may be required throughout life in severe cases.
