Pelger-Huet Anomaly
===================

**Liaison:** Hazel Fitzgibbon **Email:** <Smiliesam@hotmail.com>

<div>

Pelger-Huët anomaly (PHA) is a rare, inherited blood condition in which
the nuclei of several types of white blood cells (neutrophils and
eosinophils) have unusual shape (bilobed or dumbbell-shaped) and
structure (coarse and lumpy).  It may also be called Pelger's nuclear
anomaly, or Pelger-Huët nuclear anomaly. 

The disorder appears to be an autosomal dominant genetic trait (not
related to sex of animal, and one copy of gene leads to disorder) that
has been reported to occur in foxhounds, Samoyeds and other dogs, e.g.
Basenji. It is also a known problem in Australian Shepherd dogs,
although in this breed the penetrance of the trait appears incomplete
(dog may have defective gene without exhibiting the disorder).  It been
reported in humans, rabbits, mice and domestic short-haired cats.

[By itself, PHA is no problem. It does not make the affected animal any
more prone to infection.  In other species it can be associated with
additional problems. When homozygous in humans (two copies of defective
gene) it is associated with skeletal abnormalities. In one family of
Samoyeds, white cell changes similar to PHA were reported along with
dwarfism and ocular problems.  ]{.dochitextractnohit}

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

When only one defective copy of the gene is inherited (heterozygous),
PHA can exist by itself with no detrimental effect to the dog.  However,
if a defective gene is inherited from each parent (homozygous), the
disorder in dogs is typically lethal in utero or shortly after birth,
leading to:

-   Neonatal deaths
-   Lower litter sizes surviving to weaning than in normal dogs

Causes
------

In humans, mutations in the Lamin B Receptor (LBR) gene, which codes for
a protein in the nuclear membrane, have been identified as being
responsible for PHA.    The responsible gene has not yet been identified
in dogs.

Risk Factors

Related dogs with the condition

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The condition is diagnosed by observation of white cells in a blood
smear. Bilobed or dumbbell-shaped neutrophils with more condensed
chromatin (nuclear material) are seen.  The total white count is normal,
but the differential count (distribution of types of white cells) is
atypical.

As the condition is associated with some fairly extreme skeletal
disorders in humans, and may have been seen with skeletal disorders in
Samoyeds, it is wise to test for other symptoms that could be associated
with PHA. For instance, if it is found in association with retinal
folds, a degree of dwarfism could be suspected.

PHA must be distinguished from Pseudo PHA, which is an acquired
condition with similar white cell changes.  Pseudo PHA in humans has
been associated with:

-   Blood disorders such as anemia, leukemia and myelodysplastic
    syndromes
-   Drug therapy with colchicines or ibuprofen
-   Infections such as mononucleosis and malaria

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is no treatment for this condition.  Associated conditions should
be treated according to their presentations.

Management
----------

As this condition has been associated with extreme skeletal disorders,
it would be prudent to seek follow up screenings of parents and
siblings, even if the diagnosed animal shows no other clinical signs.
Siblings and parents should be screened with veterinarian consultations
on the advisability of using the stock in future breedings.
