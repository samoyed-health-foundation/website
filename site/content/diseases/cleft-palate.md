Cleft Palate
============

**Liaison:** Hazel Fitzgibbon **Email:** <Smiliesam@hotmail.com>

<div>

Cleft palate is a disorder occasionally seen in newborn puppies.  A
cleft palate results when the tissues forming the roof of the mouth do
not grow together normally. This leads to an opening in the roof of the
mouth that communicates with the nasal cavity. The opening can be in the
forward part of the mouth (hard palate) or at the very back (soft
palate).

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

 

Cleft palate puppies do not thrive. Because the mouth cavity connects
with the nasal cavity, they cannot develop the suction necessary to
obtain enough milk.  They may seem okay at first, but soon become weak
and fall off the teat. When they do feed, milk may be seen coming out
their noses. They snuffle a lot and sneeze.  They can aspirate milk into
their lungs, leading to pneumonia.  Because they don't get enough milk,
they lose weight and become lethargic.

 

Upon examination, an opening can be seen or felt in the roof of the
mouth (see Diagnostic Tests). 

 

Causes
------

 

Cleft palate may be genetic, or due to something that happened to the
mother during the early stages of pregnancy, such exposure to toxins,
drugs (for example, cortisone or hydroxyurea) or some viruses. 
Nutritional factors, either folic acid deficiency or vitamin A excess,
have also been suggested.

Risk Factors
------------

 

Family history if genetic; exposure to toxins or drugs during
pregnancy;  nutrition during pregnancy.

 

Cleft palate is most common in brachycephalic breeds (those with broad
heads and very short,  muzzles).

 

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The palate is examined by visual inspection or by feel.  New born whelps
should all be examined to see if the roofs of their mouths are complete.
If you cannot actually see down the length of the palate, running a
finger down the centre of the top of the mouth will give you an idea.
You can feel even a slight cleft; it feels like the teeth on a zip
fastener. The cleft can be slight, just being at the very back of the
mouth, or extensive with a slit from the back to the front of the mouth,
sometimes even including the lip.   An experienced breeder or
veterinarian should be able to diagnose the problem. Newly certified
vets might never have seen a cleft palate, so rely on experience on this
one.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

In the interests of the puppy, the owner should consider euthanization.
Although euthanizing costs money, it is unfair to let such puppies
starve to death, and be of no doubt, unless you tube feed, this is the
inevitable result. With tube feeding, the puppy may still die or die
from complications of pneumonia caused by food or liquids getting into
the lungs.

If you consider corrective surgery, it can't be done until the puppy is
older, and even then may not be successful.  Defects of the hard palate
are more difficult to correct than defects of the soft palate.  The
puppy would have to be tube fed (round the clock at first) for months
until surgery could be performed. 

 

Management
----------

Research has yet to determine the exact cause of cleft palate and
considering the life threatening aspects and hardship to both owner and
puppy, it would be ill advised to breed an animal who survived until
adulthood.  See 'Suggested Links' for stories from breeders who have run
such puppies on.

No support group currently available. There are some individual accounts
of raising and losing puppies. Most literature is about the problem in
humans.
