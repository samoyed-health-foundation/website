Hemophilia is a disease of the clotting system of the blood and is the
most common bleeding disorder in cats and dogs.  The clotting mechanism
is a cascade of events, each event dependent on a different protein
factor. There are two primary types of hemophilia: hemophilia A and
hemophilia B.  Hemophilia A is a deficiency of factor VIII; hemophilia B
is a deficiency of factor IX. Hemophilia A is more common and its
severity is dependent on the level of factor VIII activity. Hemophilia B
is more rare but is often more severe.

Hemophilia is transmitted by X-linked inheritance, a type of inheritance
where the abnormal gene is carried on the X chromosome. This means it is
transmitted by mothers to sons through the X chromosome. Thus the
disease shows up mostly in males because they have only one X
chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes (and only one is
typically affected) they show fewer signs of the disease but are
carriers and may pass the disease on to their sons. It is more common in
some breeds than others, and the Samoyed is listed on several websites
as one of these breeds. However, the original source of this information
is unclear, and the disease has not been described in Samoyeds in the
scientific literature.  It is a relatively rare disease in Samoyeds.

There are more than a dozen proteins involved in the clotting mechanism.
Hemophilia A and B are only two of the bleeding disorders that may be
seen in dogs, there are at least five others that have been reported in
one or more breeds, including a deficiency of von Willebrand Factor.
The other bleeding disorders are also inherited, but not X-linked. They
have not been reported in Samoyeds.

This paper is a good review of canine bleeding disorders:

## Signs and Symptoms

Depending on the severity of the disease, signs range from few, if any,
to severe problems with bleeding. In mild cases there may only be
problems with surgery or with trauma. In more severe cases there can be
spontaneous bleeding under the skin, into joints or internally.

First signs may be prolonged bleeding with loss of baby teeth, swelling
and lameness of a joint following very mild trauma, bloody diarrhea, and
hematomas (lumps under the skin caused by local bleeding) often
following vaccinations. Prolonged and/or recurrent bleeding into joints
and muscles is common in more severe cases and can result in permanent
lameness and deformity. In very severe cases the dog may bleed to death
at a very young age.

## Causes

As noted above, hemophilia A and B are X-linked inherited defects.

## Risk Factors

Related family members with the disease.

## Diagnostic Tests

If a dog appears to have a bleeding disorder based on an exam and
history, the first step is typically a panel of special bleeding tests
(coagulation panel) to evaluate the blood's ability to clot in a test
tube. Results of these tests can help determine which of the many
factors in the clotting cascade might be low/missing.

Once the coagulation profile is determined, specific assays are
available for the levels of factor VIII, factor IX, and some other
factors.  These tests can confirm that a dog has a specific bleeding
disorder, but it cannot rule out a carrier state because carriers may
have normal levels.

Genetic (DNA) tests for the carrier state of Hemophilia B, factor VII
deficiency and von Willebrand's disease (another clotting disorder) are
available from VetGen for certain breeds, but not for Samoyeds.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Mild cases may require no treatment.

More severe cases may require periodic blood or plasma transfusions.
These may need to be repeated frequently during episodes of bleeding
until the bleeding has stopped. A problem with transfusions is they may
become ineffective because of the development of antibodies against the
factor, rendering it ineffective.

Gene transfer (gene therapy) is a process where a normal gene for a
factor is inserted into an animal's cells so that the animal can make
the missing factor. Research has been ongoing for many years, mostly
with disappointment. In recent years, however, it has been more
promising. Although there have been canine cures described, I was unable
to find any evidence that it is being used in canines for anything other
than research purposes. It could have the same problem with development
of antibodies as plasma transfusions. I suspect that this treatment is
prohibitively expensive.

## Management

Affected dogs (male or female), known carriers and females related to
affected males should not be bred.
