Muscular Dystrophy (X-Linked)
=============================

**Liaison:** Jan Young **Email:** <jannermd@yahoo.com>



Muscular dystrophy is an inherited type of muscle disease (myopathy)
that is progressive and nonregenerative (permanent loss of muscle tissue
and muscle use). X-linked refers to a specific type of muscular
dystrophy that is transmitted by mothers to sons through the X
chromosome. The disease shows up predominantly in males because they
have only one X chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes (and
only one is typically affected) they may be carriers, but show little or
no signs of disease.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Signs and symptoms begin in early puppy hood and are almost always
present by six to nine weeks of age. Muscle weakness and exercise
intolerance are the first signs. Gait may be awkward or stiff, and the
head may hang low because of weak neck muscles. As the disease
progresses, the tongue may become enlarged and the dog has decreased
ability to move the tongue resulting in excessive drooling, difficulty
swallowing, and difficulty breathing. There is also a gradual increase
in generalized weakness and exercise intolerance as the muscle disease
progresses, and there begins to be obvious muscle wasting (atrophy).
Dogs are able to chew normally but often drop food when swallowing and
are not able to drink normally.



Depending on the severity of the disease, dogs may die very young, or,
on occasion, live several years. Eventually the muscles of the heart
become involved and this is often the cause of death.

Causes
------

X-linked Muscular Dystrophy (XLMD) is caused by a mutation in the
dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. This gene is responsible for making
a protein called dystrophin. The function of this protein is to
stabilize the muscle membrane during contraction, and when this protein
is deficient, muscle disease results. It is more common in some breeds
than in others, and the Samoyed is one of the breeds in which it is more
common. It is very similar to X-linked Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in
humans.

Risk Factors
------------

This is a genetically transmitted disease and animals with this defect
in their line should not be bred. As noted above, male dogs are at much
greater risk for exhibiting the disorder, but females are at risk for
being carriers and having affected male offspring.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Muscle biopsy is the definitive diagnostic tool when a myopathy or
dystrophy is suspected. It is extremely important that an accurate
diagnosis be made because there are many types of canine myopathy, many
of them genetic, and there are different treatments and prognosis based
on the specific type of myopathy. Because of the genetic etiology
(cause) of this disease XLMD, it is extremely important to make an
accurate diagnosis so appropriate breeding decisions can be made.

Because certain infections such as toxoplasmosis can mimic the signs and
symptoms of muscular dystrophy, blood tests may also be obtained to rule
these out.

Creatine kinase (CK) levels are abnormally high in affected pups as
young as one week of age, making it possible to identify affected dogs
when XLMD is present in a line or is otherwise suspected. Creatine
kinase is a measure of muscle injury or breakdown, as seen in
progressive myopathies, including XLMD.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is no cure and no specific treatment for XLMD. Steroid treatment
(prednisone) and/or growth factors may help slow the progression but
their efficacy is not proven and they can be prohibitively expensive.

In 2006 stem cell therapy appeared promising although it was not
effective in all dogs and it was not understood why. Since 2009 gene
therapy research has been very promising. Unfortunately both of these
potential therapies are still at the experimental stage and not
available outside the laboratory.
