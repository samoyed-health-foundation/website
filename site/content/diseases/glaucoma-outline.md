Glaucoma affects a relatively low number of Samoyeds so many people may not know much about it. Recognizing the symptoms of an acute attack, knowing it’s an emergency and what to do is critical if you are to save your dog’s eyesight. Additionally, understanding the anatomy of the eye enough to understand the cause of glaucoma is useful to owners who may have a dog that develops glaucoma, as well as to breeders as they work to prevent the genetic forms of glaucoma.

Glaucoma is defined as an abnormal rise in intraocular pressure in the eye that can lead to damage to the optic nerve. So, no matter what causes the rise in pressure it is called glaucoma. Glaucoma may be primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by another eye condition or trauma). Any form of inflammation can cause glaucoma. It’s important to know that glaucoma in dogs is not like that in humans. While most human glaucoma can be medically managed it is rare in dogs for that to be the case. Glaucoma usually starts in one eye but will affect both eyes eventually. If the pressure becomes too high, the optic nerve can be damaged leading to blindness.

There are three classifications of primary glaucoma: open-angle, closed-angle, or goniodysgenesis.

* Open angle (what most humans have) is due to a genetic mutation which causes the wrong protein to be coded by the gene. This leads to a slow, gradual clogging of the drainage system, rather like the kitchen sink slowly clogging over time.
* Closed angle glaucoma occurs when the drainage angle (iridocorneal angle) is too tight and fluid cannot easily drain from the eye. It can occur slowly (chronic) or very suddenly (acute). Acute onset of glaucoma is always an emergency requiring immediate medical attention.
* Goniodysgenesis refers to the malformation of the trabecular mesh (pectinate ligaments) that hold the eye structures in place. This form of glaucoma is also called closed angle as the iridocorneal angle is usually narrowed. The trabecular network that forms the suspensory ligaments is a solid sheet of tissue that separates into a spread finger-like configuration during fetal development. If this separation is not complete the openings may be smaller or sections may be closed. This reduces the drainage of fluid from the eye, rather as if the kitchen sink is malformed and has very small drain holes. The first illustration shows the components of the canine eye and the second the flow of fluid from the eye.

Glaucoma from goniodysgenesis is not usually diagnosed in a young dog as there is another contributing factor. The dog’s lens continues to grow and thicken as the dog ages reducing the anterior chamber depth and causing the iris to deform and close off the drainage opening. There is also a narrowing of the opening between the lens and the iris. Fluid passing through narrow areas causes turbulence and this adds to the drainage problem. The most frequent age for diagnosis is between 5 and 8 years, although it can occasionally occur much younger or older.

## Signs and Symptoms

When the internal ocular pressure (IOP) rises rapidly there is tremendous pain and the process will cause the development of toxic chemicals that will reach a level that begins to cause destruction of the retinal nerve within 4 hours. This development occurs most often at dusk and so it has been called the “5 o’clock emergency”. The dog will shy away from movement towards their eye, the third eyelid will be closing, and the eye will appear bloodshot.

## Causes

Glaucoma is caused by inadequate drainage of the aqueous fluid in the eye. The cause of the inadequate drainage depends on the type of glaucoma. It can be primary (genetic), or secondary to trauma, disease or inflammation.
