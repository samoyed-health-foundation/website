Piebald or Extreme Piebald Gene -- Deafness
===========================================

**Liaison:** Hazel Fitzgibbon **Email:** <Smiliesam@hotmail.com>



Piebald is defined as 'having patches of black and white or of other
colors; parti-colored' (Dictionary.com).  In piebald animals this
happens through the effect of the piebald gene 'covering,' in some or
all areas, the effect of another gene for an underlying coat color.
Samoyeds are said to have two copies of the extreme piebald gene (Little
1967).  For many years deafness has been associated with this colour
pattern, as well as with Merle.

One mechanism connecting lack of colour and deafness has now been
identified.  There are small hairs in the inner ear called cilia. In the
puppy who will hear, these hairs develop normally.  If the extreme
piebald gene is present, pigment cells (melanocytes) are suppressed and
these hairs may not develop properly.

"It has been shown in mice that the presence of pigment cells is
essential for normal inner ear development.  They normally colonize the
stria vascularis.  However, in their absence, as is also well documented
in the dog, the stria vascularis degenerates.  As this provides the
blood supply to the cochlea, damage to this structure occurs and the
sensory hair cells necessary for hearing die." (quote from:

There is as yet no definitive proof that the extreme piebald gene is
associated with hereditary deafness in Samoyeds.  A lot of very
persuasive work has been done on deafness in Dalmatians and Border
Collies, other breeds who carry this gene.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

A deaf baby puppy may exhibit signs including;

-   Not following siblings cries when feeding, thus they may not get
    enough food and may not thrive well.
-   Irritability towards siblings - being unable to hear audible
    communications.
-   Non reactive to loud noises.

An adult may also exhibit fear biting as the result of a deaf dog being
startled.



Causes
------

Deafness associated with piebald coloring is inherited in some breeds,
but the presence of the gene by itself is not sufficient to cause
deafness.  For example, all Dalmatians have two copies of the extreme
piebald gene (homozygous), but not all of them are deaf -- there appear
to be other genes involved as well.

However, it is important to eliminate other causes for deafness before
coming to a conclusion that your animal is deaf due to the extreme
piebald gene.  Deafness in Samoyeds is not common, but may be attributed
to any of the following, or a combination thereof;

1.  Congenital (present at birth) - Genetic (hereditary)
2.  Congenital (present at birth) - Acquired (for example, dam exposed
    to toxic drug)
3.  Otitis (inflammation) through bacteria or fungal infections in Inner
    or Outer Ear
4.  Injury by accident or foreign body invasion
5.  Old age (Presbycusis)
6.  Drug Toxicity including General Anaesthesia
7.  Noise Trauma

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The BAER test is an extremely reliable, objective test used to determine
if a dog is deaf in one or both ears.  If the deafness is partial, it
can also measure the extent of hearing loss.  BAER stands for
\"Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response.\" It is a procedure using
computer-regulated sensors to record the electrical activity of the
brain in response to sound stimulation. Electrodes are put just under
the skin, but these do not seem to bother most dogs.

Contrary to popular belief, puppies are not 'born deaf'. Puppies are
born with a covering across the ear which prevents sound from reaching
the functioning hearing organs. In normal development, this
disintegrates about the same time as eyes open.  The BAER test can only
be performed after this happens, once a puppy is 4-5 weeks old.

The piebald gene in dogs has recently been located on dog chromosome 20
and identified as "*Mitf*."  Researchers are looking for other genes
associated with deafness in dogs carrying the extreme piebald gene.  At
the time of writing, there is no genetic test for hereditary deafness
in Samoyeds.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

With congenital deafness, there is no cure.

Management
----------

While congenital deafness does not cause pain, it is the repercussions
that are limiting, even dangerous. Deafness poses a problem in that it
can't be seen by breeders or owners. While you can accommodate a blind
dog quickly as the disability is fairly obvious, a deaf dog is not so
obvious.  Dogs adapt very well to losing a sensory organ and try to fill
in the loss by augmenting their other senses.

Dogs who are deaf in one ear can usually lead a relatively normal life.
Dogs who are deaf in both ears can be a danger to themselves if not
managed properly. One thing that appears and re-appears on sites of
different breeds is that a deaf dog cannot hear a car coming. Ensuing
injuries cause distress to the dog and owner.

Deaf dogs can be trained to follow hand signals, instead of voice
commands.

Affected dogs should not be bred.  Matings that produce deaf dogs should
not be repeated.
