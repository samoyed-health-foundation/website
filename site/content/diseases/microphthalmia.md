## Summary

Usually diagnosed in young puppies, microphthalmia* literally means
'small eye'.  Due to a defect early in fetal development, the eye does
not grow at the same rate as the rest of the head and therefore looks
smaller than it should.  Eyes may look a little sunken.  Third eyelids
can be prominent.

Microphthalmia itself will not stop your Samoyed from seeing.  It is the
'nasties' that go with it that can be the problem.  It is often
associated with other defects (ocular dysgenesis).  These may include
defects of the cornea, lens, retina, or anterior chamber of the eye.
There can also be coloboma, a cleft in a portion of the eye, such as the
iris.  Cataracts are often associated with microphthalmia and can cause
partial to total blindness.

\*Microphthalmia is often misspelled as micropthalmia on the internet.

## Signs and Symptoms

This condition is apparent in pups once their eyes have opened. Affected
eyes are smaller than normal and appear recessed. The third eyelid may
be more prominent.  One or both eyes may be affected.

## Causes

This is a congenital condition (present at birth), being nondevelopment
of the eye.   In some breeds, it has been found to be inherited, often
associated with "merle" coat coloring.  The genetics have been
well-studied in mice, where mutations in the regulatory gene MITF
(microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) affect the development
of pigment cells (melanocytes) and can lead to microphthalmia, deafness,
and loss of pigmentation.   The MITF gene in dogs has recently been
identified and shown to be associated with white spotting or piebald
coat coloring in several breeds.

Microphthalmia might also be inherited in Samoyeds, but this has not
been determined.  There are also references to pesticides and wormers
causing the problem.

## Risk Factors

Related dogs with microphthalmia.  In some other breeds, having both
sire and dam with merle coat coloring is a risk factor.

## Diagnostic Tests

It is visible to the naked eye. The third eyelid (the white bit in the
corner) often looks larger than normal.  Examination by a veterinary
ophthalmologist, who will also examine your dog's eyes thoroughly for
other abnormalities, will give a definitive diagnosis.  The examination
is non-invasive, using light and magnifying lenses to examine and look
inside the eye.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

The basic defect can't be treated.  Associated complications, such as
glaucoma, are treated as required.

## Management

The degree of visual impairment depends on the severity of the defect.
If the eyeballs fill half of the openings, there is a 50% chance the
puppy will be blind.  If more severe, most puppies are blind.  Vision
can also be impaired by the associated defects, such as cataracts.
Puppies with cataracts typically have some visual impairment because
when the eye opens for the first time, daylight cannot penetrate the
cataract and the retina is not 'activated' into proper operation.
Sometimes cataracts improve over time, although their reabsorption may
lead to leakage of liquefied lens material and inflammation.  Sometimes
they get worse.  It is unpredictable.

Dogs are so good at using their senses of smell and hearing to
compensate for poor vision that when your dog is in familiar
surroundings, you may not even be aware of the extent of his vision
loss.  To assist your dog, keep his environment consistent.  Don't move
the furniture, or if you must, make changes gradually.  Routes for walks
should be consistent.

Because it is a serious disease for both the animal and the owner and
might be inherited, animals with microphthalmia should not be bred. If
the parents or normal-eyed siblings are breed, it should be with great
caution, as the genetics of microphthalmia have not been worked out.

There are many of web sites for other breeds, but none specifically for
Samoyeds. A number of these sites associate microphthalmia with merling
and coat colours. Some also associate deafness with merling and
microphthalmia.   Merling has not been associated with Samoyeds.  ![3
