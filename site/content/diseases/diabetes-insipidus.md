*Diabetes insipidus* is an endocrine disease characterized by the
inability of the kidney to concentrate urine.  This results from a
failure to reabsorb water from the glomerular filtrate back into
circulation.  Symptoms include polyuria (excessive urination) and
polydipsia (excessive thirst).

*Diabetes insipidus* has been described in dogs as early as 1951
\[1\]. *Diabetes insipidus* is a disease of the endocrine system
characterized by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity.
This hormone, also referred to as vasopressin or arginine vasopressin
(AVP), is synthesized by neurons in the hypothalamus and stored in the
posterior pituitary gland. Antidiuretic hormone acts on the kidney to
promote concentration of urine by removing water from the glomerular
filtrate back into circulation. This is accomplished through the
binding of the hormone to the tubular cells of the kidney, resulting in
the insertion of a specific protein (aquaporin 2) into the cell
membrane. This protein then functions as a water channel, permitting
concentration of urine and conservation of bodily water. Antidiuretic
hormone is secreted in response to changes plasma osmolality and blood
volume. A deficiency of ADH activity can result from either

1. a deficiency of ADH (called central diabetes insipidus (CDI)), or
2. an inability of the kidney to respond to ADH (called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI))

Dogs have been reported to have both forms \[2, 3\].

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Dogs with DI present with polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia
(excessive thirst).  The polydipsia is secondary to the polyuria; that
is, the need to drink large quantities of water is caused by the loss of
water in urine.  Generally speaking, polyuria is defined as urine
production greater than 50ml/kg/day and polydipsia as water consumption
greater than 100ml/kg/day

If the water lost in the urine is not
replaced through increased consumption, dehydration can result.  Severe
dehydration can lead to coma and death.

Causes
------

The causes of DI can be congenital, involving either failure to produce
ADH (CDI) or failure to produce the correct machinery for responding to
ADH (NDI).  Thus the genetic mutation can reside in the gene that codes
for ADH (CDI) or the genes that code for the ADH receptor or aquaporin 2
(NDI) \[4\].  Diabetes insipidus can also be acquired as a result of an
insult (trauma, tumor, surgery, infection or other disease) to either
the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (CDI) or the kidney (NDI) \[5-7\].  An
excellent summary of the differences between the two forms of DI can be

Risk Factors
------------

In general, DI can affect dogs of any age, sex or breed.  The exception
is congenital DI, which is X-linked and therefore predominantly seen in
males \[4\].

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The combination of polyuria/polydipsia can be an indication of a number
of disease states, and much has been written on making a differential
diagnosis when presented with this scenario \[8, 9\] and

<http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2556>
![3 bones](/img/3-bones.gif)
Once other potential diagnoses, such as
diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, chronic renal failure or pyometra
have been ruled out, then tests for DI can be undertaken.  The first
indication of DI in a dog with polyuria/polydipsia is a low urinary
specific gravity in the face of otherwise normal blood and urine
chemistries.  In other words, the urine is very dilute, having little
color or odor.  Such findings are consistent with either DI or
psychogenic water consumption (polydipsia thought to be caused by
psychological factors and not secondary to polyuria).  To differentiate
between the two, a modified water deprivation test is carried out.  By
depriving the dog of water overnight, one can test for the ability to
make and/or respond to ADH. A normal dog or a dog with
psychogenic-mediated water consumption will produce concentrated urine
under these circumstances; a dog with DI will not.  Failure to produce
concentrated urine following water deprivation is indicative of DI.
This is usually followed by administration of a synthetic ADH analog
called desmopressin (dDAVP), which is available either as a nasal spray
(used as eye drops when given to dogs) or a more convenient pill form.
If the dog is able to concentrate urine following administration of
dDAVP, then the DI is central.  If the dog fails to concentrate, then
NDI is suspected.  These tests cannot differentiate between congenital
and acquired DI.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Diabetes insipidus is not a life-threatening disease provided the dog
has free access to water.  The excessive loss of water in urine as the
result of decreased ADH activity can easily be compensated for by an
increase in water intake.  However, DI can be a problem for dogs that
need to rely on the owners for bathroom breaks.  A dog with DI will have
to be walked more frequently than a normal dog.  In cases of CDI, the
condition can easily be treated with daily administration of dDAVP;
however, this medication is on the expensive side.  In addition,
attention must be paid to dogs that are incapacitated and may not be
able to drink freely.  For example, if a dog with DI is about to undergo
a surgical procedure, the hospital staff should be apprised of the dog's
diagnosis of DI to make sure that they are aware of and attend to his
water needs.  Nephrogenic DI, by definition, is unresponsive to ADH;
however in some cases, such as those involving a decrease in receptor
affinity, increasing the dose of dDAVP can compensate for the defect
\[4\].   In other cases, oral thiazide diuretics can, paradoxically, be
used to promote urine concentration.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs may also be effective.
