Addison’s Disease, also called hypoadrenocorticism or adrenal insufficienc, is a disorder in which the adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones to allow the body to function normally.  The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, are unable to produce sufficient amounts of cortisol and aldosterone hormones.  This disease can be life-threatening but can be managed by taking replacement hormones (1).

Addison’s disease affects humans as well as animals. In the United States Addison’s disease affects 1 in 100,000 people, men and women equally, and all age groups especially the 30-50 year olds (2).  This disease was first noticed in humans around the middle of the 19th century and was named after Thomas Addison (3). 

Addison’s disease in dogs was first officially recognized in 1953.  This disease affects some breeds of dogs more than others, and tends to affect young to middle aged female dogs (4a). 

As mentioned previously, Addison’s disease is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.  These two hormones are important because bodily functions depend on them to help sustain life.  Cortisol is important as it helps the body cope with shock, stress and acts as a natural pain killer (3). It also helps to maintain blood pressure, heart function, the immune system and blood glucose levels (2).  Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates the minerals sodium and potassium, which are key in maintaining fluid balance in the body (5).

The opposite condition of Addison’s disease is called Cushing’s disease where there is an overproduction of cortisol (6).

## Signs and Symptoms

The first signs and symptoms of dogs suffering from Addison’s disease are vague, tend to wax and wane, progress slowly and are sometimes overlooked or misdiagnosed (7).

The signs and symptoms may arise from situations that cause tension, distress, strain and nervousness.  What is defined as stress varies with each different dog’s temperament.  Some examples of overtaxing situations are grooming, having house guests, being left alone or trying to fight an infection (6). Even good stress such as a car ride can be too much for the Addisonian dog.

A healthy adrenal gland will produce enough cortisol to help deal with stressful situations, whereas compromised adrenal gland producing insufficient amounts of cortisol may lead to conditions of:

* Depression
* Lethargy
* Anorexia (lack of appetite)
* Weight loss
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Bloody stools
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Increased urination
* Increased thirst
* Dehydration
* Shaking
* Weak pulse
* Irregular heart rate
* Low temperature
* Painful abdomen
* Hypoglycemia
* Hyperpigmentation of the skin

In general, these dogs seem overall unwell and weak.  Since these symptoms are sometimes not indicative of a particular disease or condition, many vets fail to promptly diagnose Addison’s disease in dogs. Addison’s disease in humans and dogs is known for causing vague symptoms which may mimic the clinical signs associated with other diseases.  Addison’s disease is sometimes referred to “The Great Pretender”.  7 Source:  www.pethelpful.com/dogs/Signs of an Addisonian Crisis in Dogs.  For example, during an examination, a vet may see lack of energy, dehydration along with increased drinking and urination, weak pulse and irregular heart rate.  Routine blood panels show a low blood sodium and high blood potassium which may be cause by the dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea.  Kidney disease is sometimes wrongly diagnosed instead of Addison’s disease.  Source:  6 Addison's Disease (wsu.edu)  

If your dog’s first signs and symptoms of Addison’s go undiagnosed and come to a critical breaking point, with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, collapse, or shock, this is known as an Addisonian crisis. An Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening event.  8 Source:  https://facty.com/network/answers/pets/what-is-addisons-disease-in-dogs 4
