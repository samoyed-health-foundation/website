Addison’s Disease, also called hypoadrenocorticism or adrenal insufficienc, is a disorder in which the adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones to allow the body to function normally.  The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, are unable to produce sufficient amounts of cortisol and aldosterone hormones.  This disease can be life-threatening but can be managed by taking replacement hormones (1).

Addison’s disease affects humans as well as animals. In the United States Addison’s disease affects 1 in 100,000 people, men and women equally, and all age groups especially the 30-50 year olds (2).  This disease was first noticed in humans around the middle of the 19th century and was named after Thomas Addison (3). Addison’s disease in dogs was first officially recognized in 1953.  This disease affects some breeds of dogs more than others, and tends to affect young to middle aged female dogs. :  4a 

As mentioned previously, Addison’s disease is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.  These two hormones are important because bodily functions depend on them to help sustain life.  Cortisol is important as it helps the body cope with shock, stress and acts as a natural pain killer. 3 .  It also helps to maintain blood pressure, heart function, the immune system and blood glucose levels.  2  Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates the minerals sodium and potassium, which are key in maintaining fluid balance in the body.  5 

The opposite condition of Addison’s disease is called Cushing’s disease where there is an overproduction of cortisol.  6 S
