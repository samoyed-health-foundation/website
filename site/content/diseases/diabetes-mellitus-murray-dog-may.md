The first sign of diabetes in our much loved Murray was when we picked him up from the groomers and he was paralyzed in the back legs. This was extremely traumatising for us but more so for the Murray dog. We immediately took him to our wonderful vets who, you could tell, were equally worried. A blood test revealed high glucose levels, insulin administered, and slowly his strength improved. We had to change his prescription diet for excess calcium (bladder stones) to low fat dry food which we combine with a low fat chicken, vegetable and rice dish, Murray has always loved his food! We give insulin injections twice daily. He's 13, suffering from a degenerative spine, his back legs give way, he falls over, leans to the left, is very hard of hearing. He is on some pain relief at the moment and is enjoying life again, he brings us such joy. There are so many funny stories, his great exploits, and our family and friends have been privileged to join his life's journey.
