## **Genetic Testing Available for Disorders in Samoyeds**

The following disorders are inherited in Samoyeds and genetic testing is available. Links to several laboratories that offer genetic testing are listed. Listing is for information only and is not a SCARF endorsement of their services. Laboratory websites are included for their descriptions of the disorders and their inheritance.

Not all laboratory results are eligible for submission to OFA as part of[ CHIC certification](https://www.ofa.org/about/chic-program).  If CHIC certification is the goal, please verify which tests are required and whether results from a particular laboratory will be accepted. OFA-CHIC requirements for Samoyeds are [listed on the OFA website](https://www.ofa.org/recommended-tests?breed=SA) and currently include genetic tests for X-linked Progressive Retinal Atrophy and Retinal Dysplasia/Oculoskeletal Dysplasia 2. Several laboratories offer DNA testing panels ([Wisdom](https://wisdompanel.com/en-us/products/wisdom-panel-premium), [Embark](https://shop.embarkvet.com/products/embark-dog-dna-test-kit)).  At this time the panels do not include all the disorders listed here, or all the disorders required for CHIC certification. *(Information current October 6, 2020).*
