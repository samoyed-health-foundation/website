# **Genetic Testing Available for Disorders in Samoyeds** 

The following disorders are inherited in Samoyeds and genetic testing is available. Links to several laboratories that offer genetic testing are listed. Listing is for information only and is not a SCARF endorsement of their services. Not all laboratory results are eligible for submission to the OFA as part of[ CHIC certification](<https://www.ofa.org/about/chic-program>).  Laboratory websites include descriptions of the disorder and its inheritance.
