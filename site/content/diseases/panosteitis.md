Panosteitis literally means \"inflammation of all bones\".  It is a
disease of the fatty bone marrow which causes secondary changes to the
long bones.  Affected dogs exhibit intermittent lameness in one or more
legs, either simultaneously or sequentially.  Lameness in one leg may
last for days to weeks, then another leg may be affected.  This cycle of
lameness typically lasts three months.  There can be multiple cycles,
with months in between.  The disease generally disappears by the time
the dog is two years old.

Canine panosteitis occurs spontaneously in young, large breed dogs,
especially German Shepherds.  It has also been reported in the Bassett
Hound, Scottish Terrier, Great Dane, St. Bernard, Doberman Pinscher,
German Shorthaired Pointer, Irish Setter, Airedale, Golden Retriever,
Labrador Retriever, Samoyed, and Miniature Schnauzer.     

The disease has also been called juvenile osteomyelitis, enostosis, and
eosinophilic panosteitis.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

The main sign of canine panosteitis is sudden lameness in one or more
legs in a young dog, with no history of trauma.  The average age of
onset is 5 - 12 months, although it has been reported in dogs as young
as two months and as old as five years.  It is more common for males to
be affected than females, and in females, the panosteitis often occurs
with the first estrus.

The lameness is caused by pain, which can range from slight to severe,
with lameness also being minimal to severe.  Affected dogs may also be
depressed and lose their appetite.

Causes
------

The exact cause of panosteitis is unknown.  Genetics seems to be a
factor, especially in German Shepherds where the disease is especially
prevalent.   Other suggested causes include diet, stress, infection, and
metabolic or autoimmune problems.  High calcium, high protein, and/or
high calorie diets have been suggested as a cause, but there does not
appear to be general agreement on this.

Risk Factors
------------

Panosteitis in related dogs (genetics) and diet *may* be risk factors.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Panosteitis can be a difficult disease to diagnose.  The lameness can
shift from limb to limb.  X-rays can show changes in the middle of the
long bones, but the x-rays can be difficult to interpret if taken at
early or late stages of the disease.  There is typically pain when the
shaft of the affected bones is pressed firmly.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

**Conventional Treatments**:  Pain killers or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs are used to relieve the pain.  If these are not
effective, corticosteroids are sometimes used.

**Alternative/holistic**:  Some suggest using fish or salmon oil, borage
oil, and bromelian as anti-inflammatory agents.

Management
----------

Panosteitis will eventually go away, with or without treatment. 
Therefore the aim is to keep the dog comfortable. 

The Suggested Links (below) have additional advice on diet and other
management tips.
