My 7 yr old male Samoyed had 5-6 months of chronic diarrhea that was not alleviated by deworming or antibiotics.  His blood panel was normal.  Ultrasound revealed a thickening of the mucosal gut lining (from 3 to 5 mm), some cellular infiltration of the lining and no enlargement of the surrounding lymph nodes.  Cancer was ruled out. Since biopsy results would have led to the same treatment we elected not biopsy.  The dog was spared this invasive surgery and we the extra expense.  For about 1 month we successfully fed a cooked diet. Then one day he stole and devoured the raw hamburger off the counter.  Taking his lead, we switched to a raw chicken-based commercial diet and had no further problems.  He died at age 12 of oral melanoma.  In retrospect he may not have had strictly defined IBD or we may have caught the gut sensitization early enough to reverse it.
