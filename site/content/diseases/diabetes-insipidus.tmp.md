Diabetes Insipidus
==================

**Liaison:** Marie Monaco **Email:** <monaco678@gmail.com>



*Diabetes insipidus* is an endocrine disease characterized by the
inability of the kidney to concentrate urine.Â  This results from a
failure to reabsorb water from the glomerular filtrate back into
circulation.Â  Symptoms include polyuria (excessive urination) and
polydipsia (excessive thirst).

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Dogs with DI present with polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia
(excessive thirst).Â  The polydipsia is secondary to the polyuria; that
is, the need to drink large quantities of water is caused by the loss of
water in urine.Â  Generally speaking, polyuria is defined as urine
production greater than 50ml/kg/day and polydipsia as water consumption
greater than 100ml/kg/day
<http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2556>Â !\[3

replaced through increased consumption, dehydration can result.Â  Severe
dehydration can lead to coma and death.

Causes
------

The causes of DI can be congenital, involving either failure to produce
ADH (CDI) or failure to produce the correct machinery for responding to
ADH (NDI).Â  Thus the genetic mutation can reside in the gene that codes
for ADH (CDI) or the genes that code for the ADH receptor or aquaporin 2
(NDI) \[4\].Â  Diabetes insipidus can also be acquired as a result of an
insult (trauma, tumor, surgery, infection or other disease) to either
the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (CDI) or the kidney (NDI) \[5-7\].Â Â An
excellent summary of the differences between the two forms of DI can be

Risk Factors
------------

In general, DI can affect dogs of any age, sex or breed.Â  The exception
is congenital DI, which is X-linked and therefore predominantly seen in
males \[4\].Â

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

The combination of polyuria/polydipsia can be an indication of a number
of disease states, and much has been written on making a differential
diagnosis when presented with this scenario \[8, 9\] and

<http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2556>Â !\[3

diabetes mellitus, Cushingâ€™s disease, chronic renal failure or
pyometra have been ruled out, then tests for DI can be undertaken.Â  The
first indication of DI in a dog with polyuria/polydipsia is a low
urinary specific gravity in the face of otherwise normal blood and urine
chemistries.Â  In other words, the urine is very dilute, having little
color or odor.Â  Such findings are consistent with either DI or
psychogenic water consumption (polydipsia thought to be caused by
psychological factors and not secondary to polyuria).Â  To differentiate
between the two, a modified water deprivation test is carried out.Â  By
depriving the dog of water overnight, one can test for the ability to
make and/or respond to ADH. A normal dog or a dog with
psychogenic-mediated water consumption will produce concentrated urine
under these circumstances; a dog with DI will not.Â  Failure to produce
concentrated urine following water deprivation is indicative of DI.Â
This is usually followed by administration of a synthetic ADH analog
called desmopressin (dDAVP), which is available either as a nasal spray
(used as eye drops when given to dogs) or a more convenient pill
form.Â Â  If the dog is able to concentrate urine following
administration of dDAVP, then the DI is central.Â  If the dog fails to
concentrate, then NDI is suspected.Â  These tests cannot differentiate
between congenital and acquired DI.Â

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Diabetes insipidus is not a life-threatening disease provided the dog
has free access to water.Â  The excessive loss of water in urine as the
result of decreased ADH activity can easily be compensated for by an
increase in water intake.Â  However, DI can be a problem for dogs that
need to rely on the owners for bathroom breaks.Â  A dog with DI will
have to be walked more frequently than a normal dog.Â  In cases of CDI,
the condition can easily be treated with daily administration of dDAVP;
however, this medication is on the expensive side.Â  In addition,
attention must be paid to dogs that are incapacitated and may not be
able to drink freely.Â  For example, if a dog with DI is about to
undergo a surgical procedure, the hospital staff should be apprised of
the dogâ€™s diagnosis of DI to make sure that they are aware of and
attend to his water needs.Â  Nephrogenic DI, by definition, is
unresponsive to ADH; however in some cases, such as those involving a
decrease in receptor affinity, increasing the dose of dDAVP can
compensate for the defect \[4\].Â Â  In other cases, oral thiazide
diuretics can, paradoxically, be used to promote urine concentration.Â
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be effective.
