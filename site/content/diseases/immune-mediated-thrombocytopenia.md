title: Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia
---
Thank you to Patti Emmett, MS, RN, CIC for putting together and updating this article for SCARF.

Decreased numbers of blood platelets due to platelet destruction by the
immune system.

## Signs and Symptoms

Spontaneous visible bruising is the major clinical sign.  Small spidery
spots of bruising clustered together are called "petechiae".
Petechiae are the most common sign.  Larger purple areas of bruising are
called "ecchymosis".

## Causes

In many cases, a cause isn't found.  In some cases, a primary reaction
by the immune system precedes the act of platelet destruction.

Examples of reactions in the immune system that could be followed by
platelet destruction include:

* a parasitic infection of blood (Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted
  Fever)
* a tumor
* drugs (chemotherapy agents, sulfonamide and chloramphenicol
  antibiotics)
* Lupus

## Risk Factors

* exposure to ticks and tick-borne blood parasites
* pre-existing Lupus
* a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer
* certain treatments for cancer and infections

## Diagnostic Tests

Inspection of gums and mouth, whites of the eyes, and abdomen may reveal
petechiae or ecchymosis.  Blood platelet counts can determine if numbers
of platelets are normal or too low, or appear abnormal.  Tests are not
yet available to detect anti-platelet antibodies.  Veterinarian
diagnosis on a case-by-case basis, using tests for other diseases
combined with symptom assessment.

## Treatment Guidelines

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

* Treatment of the cause, if known
* Prednisone or dexamethasone immunosuppression
* Azathioprine if no response to above
* Transfusion when a crisis occurs
* Splenectomy
