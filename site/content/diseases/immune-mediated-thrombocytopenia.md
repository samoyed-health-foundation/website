Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Spontaneous visible bruising is the major clinical sign.  Small spidery
spots of bruising clustered together are called \"petechiae\". 
Petechiae are the most common sign.  Larger purple areas of bruising are
called \"ecchymosis\". 

Causes
------

In many cases, a cause isn\'t found.  In some cases, a primary reaction
by the immune system precedes the act of platelet destruction. 

 

Examples of reactions in the immune system that could be followed by
platelet destruction include:

-   <div>

    a parasitic infection of blood (Ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted
    Fever)

    </div>

-   <div>

    a tumor

    </div>

-   <div>

    drugs (chemotherapy agents, sulfonamide and chloramphenicol
    antibiotics)

    </div>

-   <div>

    Lupus

    </div>

Risk Factors
------------

-   <div>

    exposure to ticks and tick-borne blood parasites

    </div>

-   <div>

    pre-existing Lupus

    </div>

-   <div>

    a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer

    </div>

-   <div>

    certain treatments for cancer and infections

    </div>

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Inspection of gums and mouth, whites of the eyes, and abdomen may reveal
petechiae or ecchymosis.  Blood platelet counts can determine if numbers
of platelets are normal or too low, or appear abnormal.  Tests are not
yet available to detect anti-platelet antibodies.  Veterinarian
diagnosis on a case-by-case basis, using tests for other diseases
combined with symptom assessment.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

-   Treatment of the cause, if known
-   Prednisone or dexamethasone immunosuppression
-   Azathioprine if no response to above
-   Transfusion when a crisis occurs
-   Splenectomy
