Liver Cancer
============



Tumors in the liver (also known as hepatic neoplasia) may be malignant
(cancer) or benign. Cancer found in the liver can originate there
(primary) or spread (metastasize) to the liver from malignant tumors
elsewhere in the body (secondary - more common in dogs).

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Signs are similar to those of other liver diseases where there is loss
of liver function. Because the liver has a lot of reserve capacity,
signs are often only seen after a large part of the liver is damaged.
Signs may include:



-   Pale gums
-   Decreased appetite
-   Vomiting
-   Weakness
-   Swelling of the abdomen (ascites)
-   Jaundice Weight loss



If the cancer in the liver started in another organ, there may also be
signs from the original cancer.

Causes
------

Primary liver cancer is thought to be caused by toxins. Because one of
the liver\'s functions is detoxification of substances filtered from
blood, it is exposed to anything ingested and absorbed into the
bloodstream.

Secondary liver cancer is due to metastases (spread) of cancer from
another area of the body.

Risk Factors
------------

Exposure to toxins (primary liver cancer).

Cancer in another area of the body (secondary liver cancer).

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

A differential diagnosis must differentiate liver cancer from other
liver diseases, such as infection or parasites. Diagnosis must also
differentiate between benign and malignant tumors, and primary or
secondary cancer.

Tests include:

-   Physical examination with palpation of abdomen to feel for masses
    (can detect enlarged liver)
-   Blood tests to evaluate liver function and \"liver enzymes\" (AP or
    ALP and ALT)
-   Blood count - this can show unusual cells in some types of liver
    cancer
-   X-rays and ultrasound can detect masses but cannot tell definitively
    whether they are malignant or benign.
-   Ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate - however, pre-surgery fine
    needle aspirates differ from surgical biopsy results approximately
    20% of the time
-   Most definitive test is an ultrasound guided core biopsy (large bore
    needle) or a biopsy taken at the time of tumor removal.



Decreased liver function may lead to prolonged bleeding times. Prior to
a core biopsy or liver surgery, a veterinarian may recommend that a
coagulation profile be performed.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

If the cancer is primary and just in one lobe it can often be treated by
surgical removal of the lobe. A dog can survive after removal of more
than half the liver since the liver has a large reserve capacity.
Unfortunately, this same reserve makes it possible for liver cancer to
exist and grow for a long time before signs are seen.

The location of the tumor within the liver must be considered prior to
surgery; if tumor is near the major blood vessels there is more risk of
bleeding/death from the surgery itself.

Chemotherapy is **not** very effective for treatment of primary liver
cancer.

Management
----------

Prognosis - if the cancer is also in other organs, prognosis is poor,
and management may be limited to easing discomfort. Transfusions may be
used if there is anemia.

Some recommend SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine), an amino acid, to
\"support\" the liver. Preliminary research shows some positive effects
(see [Current
Research](liver-cancer/canine-liver-cancer.html)).
