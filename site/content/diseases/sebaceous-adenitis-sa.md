Sebaceous Adenitis (SA)
=======================

**Liaison:** Tina Oswald **Email:** <tkoswald66@gmail.com>

<div>

Sebaceous Adenitis or SA, is a skin disease in which the sebaceous
glands become inflamed and destroyed, leading to progressive hair loss.
The disease is primarily seen in Standard Poodles, Akitas, and Samoyeds,
although there have been reported cases in a number of other breeds and
mixed breeds. It is a hereditary disease in Poodles, and is probably a
hereditary disease in Samoyeds. Severity of this disease varies from dog
to dog and breed to breed.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

 

SA is often mistaken for hypothyroidism because the signs are similar. 
Both diseases exhibit a musky odor, itching, scaling, hair loss, and
secondary skin infections such as yeast infections.  There are some dogs
who are affected by the disease over their entire bodies.  Some dogs
with SA will show few signs of this disease or absolutely no signs of
this disease, which is called a 'subclinical' form of the disease

Causes
------

There are no definitive known causes for Sebaceous Adenitis

Risk Factors
------------

Family history.

 

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Currently the 'gold standard' of diagnosis is by punch biopsy.  Two 6mm
punch biopsies are taken along the back of the neck between the neck and
withers, and in any affected areas.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There are currently no 'gold standard' antibiotics or supplements that
will cure Sebaceous Adenitis.   About 95% of owners with SA affected
dogs have had successful results with weekly to monthly oil soaks. 
There are a few people who have chosen to try the immune suppressing
drug Cyclosporine with minimal success.    

 

Many owners supplement their dogs diets with Vitamin A and Ester C. 
Some owners are trying Melatonin as a supplement.  

Management
----------

 

Get your dog on an oil soaking regime.  This will help the dog's skin
get the oils he is no longer producing. 

 

Look for reddish looking 'dirt' at the base of the hair shaft close to
the skin.  This is keratin which needs to be removed to keep the hair
follicles open and reduce the risk of infection.  Keratin is not water
soluble but is oil soluble.
