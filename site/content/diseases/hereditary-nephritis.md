Hereditary Nephritis (Hereditary Samoyed Glomerulopathy or X-Linked Nephritis)
==============================================================================

<div>

Nephritis literally means inflammation of the nephron, the basic unit of
the kidney. Hereditary nephritis means the condition is inherited rather
than caused by environmental factors.  It  is characterized by
progressive kidney dysfunction ultimately leading to kidney failure and
death.

In Samoyeds, hereditary nephritis is X-linked.  It  is transmitted by
mothers to sons through the X chromosome. The disease is more severe in
males because they have only one X chromosome, with death typically
occurring by 15 months.   Since females have two X chromosomes (and only
one is typically affected) their disease is less serious.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

These symptoms start very early in affected male puppies:    

-   Excessive drinking and urination

-   Vomiting, poor appetite and weight loss

-   Lethargy, muscle weakness

-   Proteinuria (protein in the urine). If severe protein loss is
    present there can be edema (swelling) of abdomen and paws.

-   Hematuria (blood in the urine)

-   Anemia from chronic renal failure

-   Decrease in kidney function (decreased glomerular filtration rate)

-   Progression to renal failure, with males dying by 15 months of age.

Carrier females also lose weight and develop proteinuria, but the
disease progresses much slower and renal failure occurs later in life.

Causes
------

The cause in Samoyeds is  an X-linked inherited genetic defect. The
disease is carried on the X-chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome
(coming from their mother) and hence the disease is more serious.
Because females have two X chromosomes (one from their mother, one from
their father) the disease is not so serious.

Risk Factors
------------

History of hereditary nephritis in a family.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

-   Urinalysis to check for protein and blood
-   CBC and serum biochemistry tests
-   Urine protein/creatinine ratio to determine severity of protein loss
    in urine (24 hour collection of urine is required to perform this
    test)
-   Blood pressure measurements

There is a DNA (genetic) test for this disease that may be obtained from
[vetGen](http://www.vetgen.com/canine-hereditary-nephritis.html){.external-link}.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

There is no curative treatment for hereditary nephritis. Special diets
(low protein, low salt, low phosphorous) may be prescribed as palliative
measures. Medications may be used to control blood pressure. Treatment
with ACE inhibitors, a type of blood pressure medication, may improve
the life span a few months, but is not curative. There is also some
research evidence that dietary modification can slow the process.

Management
----------

This is a genetically transmitted disorder.  Males with this defect
should not be bred.  Females from a line with this disorder should not
be bred unless their DNA has been tested and found to be clear of the
mutation that causes the disorder.  Affected bitches and carriers should
not be bred.
