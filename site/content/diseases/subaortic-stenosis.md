Thank you to Joy Ritter for putting together this article for SCARF.


The left ventricle (chamber) of the heart pumps oxygenated blood through
the aorta, a large blood vessel, to the rest of the body.   In subaortic
stenosis (SAS) there is a narrowing (stenosis) of the aorta just below
the aortic valve (thus the full technical name - subvalvular aortic
stenosis).  The narrowing can be minor -- a few small nodules, or major
-- a fibrous band constricting the entire aorta.  The heart must work
harder to pump blood past the constriction.  SAS is NOT usually present
at birth, but develops as the dog ages.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

The clinical signs depend on the degree of stenosis.  With a mild
stenosis, the dog may not show any ill effects, and may have a normal
lifespan.  With moderate to severe stenosis, the clinical effects are
greater. Because the heart must work harder to pump blood to the body,
it may not be able to pump enough, especially during exercise.  The dog
may seem fine at rest, but fatigue easily during exercise, or even faint
due to an inadequate blood/oxygen supply to the brain.

Because of working harder, over time the heart muscle becomes thicker
(left ventricular hypertrophy).  Eventually the heart is less and less
able to compensate for the narrow aorta and the dog may show signs of
left-sided (congestive) heart failure.  These can include tiring during
exercise, difficulty breathing, coughing, and/or poor growth.  Changes
in the heart can also cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrythmias) and/or
sudden death.

Causes
------

It is inheritable (genetic) in some breeds.  The mode of inheritance in
Samoyeds is unknown at this time.

Risk Factors
------------

Parent(s) with disease, if inheritable.  Otherwise unknown at this time.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

In young dogs (\< 6 months), or those with a mild stenosis, there may be
no outward signs.  The first indication that a dog has a problem may be
during a routine physical examination, when a veterinarian hears a heart
murmur.  There are other defects that can cause heart murmurs and some
"innocent" murmurs may disappear by the time the dog is 6 months old.
However, if a veterinarian thinks the murmur is significant, or if the
murmur persists, he may suggest additional tests.  In SAS the murmur is
caused by turbulence as the blood passes the aortic valve.   By
listening very carefully to a dog's heart, a veterinarian can determine
when during the heartbeat the murmur is heard, and from where it can be
most easily heard.  This helps determine where the defect is in the
heart. Other non-invasive tests include x-rays, ultrasound, and
electrocardiograms (ECGs).   Cardiac catheterization can be done by a
specialist to determine just how narrow the aorta is, but it is an
invasive procedure with its own risks, and usually requires a general
anesthetic.

It has been recommended by cardiologists that reevaluation of breeding
animals be performed at a minimum of 1, 2, 4, and 6 years of age due to
the late onset of some of the murmurs associated with the SAS.



Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.

Prognosis and long term management depend on the severity of the
stenosis and how much change has occurred in the heart.  With mild SAS,
routine treatment may not be required.  Antibiotics may be given at
times to treat/prevent infections since even mild infections can be
serious in a dog with a heart defect.

With moderate or severe stenosis, dogs may be given a type of drug
called a "beta-blocker" to minimize the effects of left-ventricular
hypertrophy.  Additional drug therapy and dietary restrictions may be
needed if the dog shows signs of left-sided heart failure.

Attempts to correct stenosis through surgery have met with limited
success.



Management
----------

These tips are from an owner's perspective:

Basically, special care should be given to preventing infections; even a
mild skin infection can be very serious with any dog with a heart
defect.  Anesthesia should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  Dogs
with moderate to severe SAS WILL die suddenly usually between 2-6 years
of age.  Dogs with mild SAS may live to their full lifespan.

It has been found to be genetic in other breeds; therefore, it would
seem to be of genetic origin in Samoyeds. If genetic, a dog with mild
SAS could produce ANY degree of SAS in their offspring, which would
indicate that the affected animal is not a candidate to remain in the
breeding pool.

This heart defect is relatively painless and the affected dogs seem to
limit themselves through fatigue or by being on medication.
