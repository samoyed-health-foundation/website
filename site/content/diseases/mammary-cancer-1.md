Cancerous Tumors that originate along the mammary chain. It is the
canine equivalent of human breast cancer.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

Lumps arising along the mammary chain. Most commonly in the two sets of
mammary glands closest to the hindquarters.

Causes
------

Specific causes of mammary cancers unknown. Generally cancers occur as a
result of disruption of the normally highly regulated processes of cell
division and differentiation.

Risk Factors
------------

-    Bitches intact after the first or second estrus cycle.

<!-- -->

-   Possibly obesity at 9-12 mo. of age but studies conflict.

Median age of onset is 10-11 years. Occurrence in males is less than 1%
of all mammary cancers. 70% of bitches 15 years or older will have a
clinically detectible mammary tumor and 100% will have microscopic tumor
foci.

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

-    Palpation of the area along the mammary chain and associated lymph
    nodes.

<!-- -->

-   Biopsy, sizing and histologic (microscopic) analysis of all lumps.
-   Staging of malignancy; i.e. chest X rays & abdominal ultrasound to
    look for spread to lungs and lymph nodes.
-   Cells removed from the lump with a needle may be examined (fine
    needle aspiration) but this is not as accurate as a biopsy.



Must rule out cysts, mastitis (infection of breast tissue), dermatologic
(skin) diseases and tumors that are not mammary cancer but may be
located over the mammary gland such as mast cell tumors and soft tissue
sarcomas.



One report suggests that the most important assessment of mammary tumors
may be their behavioral malignancy (will the tumor act malignant, i.e.
spread and potentially be fatal). The report says that behavioral
malignancy can be predicted with 80% accuracy by clinical examination
(tumors that cross the mid line, are not freely movable or are obviously
infiltrative eg. swollen lymph nodes) and confirmed by biopsy (evidence
of local invasion). The report suggests 90% of canine mammary tumors are
behaviorally benign.



Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

> **Note:** Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
> veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
> current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
> protocol.



Treatment depends on results of the diagnostic tests. Other factors to
be considered are behavioral malignancy, prognosis, age and physical
condition of the bitch.

**Measures that can be taken:**

1.  Surgery (lumpectomy, radical mastectomy, lymph node removal) except
    in the case of inflammatory carcinoma, where it does not increase
    survival.
2.  Anti inflammatory drugs (piroxicam) + radiation in the case of
    inflammatory carcinoma may afford palliative care.

Unlike in humans, radiation and chemotherapy are typically not very
effective in dogs, although they are used in some cases.



**Prognosis:**

**Factors indicating a good prognosis:**

1.  Small size of lump(s) (less that 3 cm) (highlights the importance of
    early detection)
2.  Absence of metastases (i.e. no spread to regional lymph nodes or
    lungs)
3.  Well differentiated (specialized) cells in tumor (lack of anaplasia:
    "primitive" cells, like stem cells)
4.  Few signs of cell division (mitotic figures) in tumor.
5.  Clean edges of tissue removed in lumpectomy (differentiated,
    non-dividing cells at margins)
6.  Absence of invasion of tumor into lymphatics or blood vessels or
    lymphoid invasion of tumor
7.  Absence of skin ulceration, swelling
8.  Tumors that are not attached to under or overlying tissues (suggests
    less rapid growth of tumor)



**Factors irrelevant to prognosis:**

1.  Spaying in adult hood
2.  Age
3.  Breed
4.  Weight
5.  Number of glands involved
6.  Number of tumors

Management
----------



Some recommend life time nutritional supplements for predisposed dogs:
Inositol hexaphosphate, 1-3 beta glucan, fucose. These have some effect
on cancer in isolated cells in the laboratory or in preliminary animal
experiments, but there has been no definitive research proving their
effectiveness.



Twenty-six percent of intact bitches are expected to eventually have
mammary cancer. If a bitch will not be used for breeding, spaying prior
to her first estrus cycle can reduce her risk of cancer to 0.5%. Spaying
after one estrus cycle reduces the risk to 8%.
