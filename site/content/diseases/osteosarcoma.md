Osteosarcoma
============

**Liaison:** Liz Swearingen **Email:** <moonmistsams@gmail.com>

<div>

Osteosarcoma (OSA) is a malignant tumor of the bone (bone cancer).  It
can develop in any bone, but occurs most often in the limbs, near the
shoulder, wrist or knee.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

The signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor:

Limbs:

-   Lameness due to inflammation, fractures or microfractures

-   Swelling or mass at the site of the tumor, sometimes painful

Lower jaw or orbital (eye socket)

-   Difficulty swallowing

Skull or vertebrae

-   Neurologic deficits

Pelvis

-   Difficulty defecating

Causes
------

The exact cause of osteosarcoma is unknown.  The tumors are often found
near growth plates, so factors promoting rapid growth rate and bone
turnover may be involved.   In animal studies, several viruses
(polyomavirus, SV-40 virus and type C retroviruses), fluoride, and
metabolites of the insecticide diflubenzuron, have been linked to
osteosarcoma.

Risk Factors
------------

-   Dog is a large or giant breed

-   Previous fractures

-   Chronic bone infections

-   Foreign bodies such as metal bone implants

-   Mutation in p53 tumor suppressor gene

-   Spaying or neutering prior to one year of age (see link below)

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

Diagnosis may include the following:

-   Physical exam to rule out other causes of lameness

-   Orthopedic exam to rule out other causes of lameness

-   Neurological exam to rule out other causes of lameness

-   X-rays of the suspected tumor 

-   X-rays of the lungs to look for metastases

-   Bone biopsy to definitively identify the tumor

-   Abdominal ultrasound (to look for metastases)

Other types of cancer and infection must be ruled out.

-   Chondrosarcoma - a tumor of the cartilage

-   Squamous cell carcinoma in the external coating of bone

-   Synovial cell sarcoma - a tumor of the joint capsule lining

-   Infection of the bone such as Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the
    fungus Coccidiodes immitis

 

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Treatment plans for osteosarcoma may be either curative or palliative
(relieve/lessen pain without curing).  

If the intent is to attempt a cure, the tumor must be removed either by
amputation or, when possible, limb sparing procedures.  Surgery may be
followed by chemotherapy to reduce metastases.  Because most tumors have
already metastasized when diagnosed, cure is difficult.

Palliative care typically includes radiation and pain medication.

Artemisinin is an herb that has been shown to kill some cancer cells in
the laboratory.  Anecdotal reports claim that it can stop the growth of
osteosarcoma in dogs, but peer-reviewed scientific research has not yet
been published.

 

**Prognosis:** 

Prognosis depends on many factors including the dog\'s age (it is more
aggressive in younger dogs), size of tumor, location of tumor, blood
levels of alkaline phosphatase, and presence of metastases.  Survival
times vary greatly.  Median survival times of 3-18 months have been
reported, depending on the location. 

Management
----------

If amputation is required, most dogs do very well on three legs, not
realizing that they are disabled!
