Elbow Dysplasia
===============

<div>

Elbow Dysplasia is the result of abnormal development of the elbow
joint.  Improper fit leads to excessive wear and tear and inflammation. 
It gets worse with age and affected dogs eventually develop degenerative
joint disease (osteoarthritis) which can be very painful.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

-   Lameness

-   Abnormal gait with inward deviation of paw

-   Decreased range of motion of the elbow joint

-   Pain

Signs can start in dogs as young as 4 months, but a dog can also have
elbow dysplasia without showing any signs.

Causes
------

Elbow dysplasia is polygenic and multifactorial.  This means it is
genetic and controlled by multiple genes, but also influenced by
environmental factors such as weight and age.

Risk Factors
------------

-   Related dogs with elbow dysplasia

-   Rapid growth of a large breed dog

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

If a dog presents with pain or lameness a veterinarian may do a physical
examination, looking for joint laxity or pain, but the definitive
diagnosis of elbow dysplasia in a dog with symptoms is by X-ray
(radiograph).   CAT scans and arthroscopy are sometimes used for further
evaluation. X-rays can also detect elbow dysplasia prior to a dog
exhibiting signs.  Because elbow dysplasia is genetic and very
undesirable, X-rays are frequently used to screen dogs prior to
breeding.  The X-rays can be sent to an organization that provides an
independent evaluation of the dog\'s elbows.  In the United States the
Orthopedic Foundation for Animals
([OFA](http://www.offa.org/){.external-link}) provides this service;
they issue an OFA elbow registry number if the elbows are normal.  If
not, the degree of dysplasia is rated as Grade I, II or III.  There are
similar organizations in other countries.  Each organization evaluates
x-rays, but there are differences in how the dog is positioned for the
x-rays, how they are evaluated, and at what age the dog can be
evaluated.  Although elbow dysplasia is genetic, a DNA test is not yet
available.

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Elbow dysplasia can be treated surgically and/or medically.  Surgery is
not successful in all cases; it is most effective when performed in
young dogs, prior to the development of degenerative changes and
osteoarthritis.   Canine anti-inflammatory medications prescribed by a
veterinarian may be used to relieve the pain (do NOT give human
painkillers unless directed by a veterinarian).  Glucosamine and
chondroitin sulfate, nutritional supplements, might help although this
has yet to be proven in stringent scientific studies. 

Management
----------

Dogs with elbow dysplasia should not be allowed to be overweight because
the extra weight can increase the stress on the elbows.  Light exercise
can maintain muscle tone but must be done carefully so as to not cause
pain or further injury to the affected joints.

 

Elbow dysplasia should also be managed in a breeding program.  Selecting
dogs for breeding based on x-ray screening can reduce, but not eliminate
elbow dysplasia, because some dogs can be \"carriers\" without
exhibiting it.  Approximately 2-4% of Samoyeds have been found to have
elbow dysplasia.  Since there are plenty of Samoyeds without elbow
dysplasia, those with any grade of the disorder should NOT be bred. 
Samoyeds with relatives with elbow dysplasia may be carriers and should
not be bred unless careful consideration of their entire pedigree shows
minimal risk.  The following OFA article discusses how to use available
information, including a \"vertical pedigree,\" to help make breeding
decisions.
