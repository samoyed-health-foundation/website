Hip Dysplasia (HD)
==================

<div>

Canine Hip Dysplasia (HD) is the abnormal development of the hip joint
such that there is not a proper fit between the ball and socket.  The
hip joint may be loose (laxity), the ball may be partially dislocated
from the socket (subluxation), or the joint can erode to the point where
the ball is no longer round and the socket is flattened (shallow
acetabulum).  Improper fit leads to excessive wear and tear with damage
to the cartilage, loss of joint lubrication and inflammation.  It gets
worse with age and affected dogs eventually develop osteoarthritis
(degenerative joint disease) which can be very painful.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

-   Pain
-   Stiffness
-   Lameness
-   Not wanting to exercise or go up stairs
-   Audible click when walking

Causes
------

HD is polygenic and multifactorial. This means it is genetic and
controlled by multiple genes, but also influenced by environmental
factors such as weight and age.

 

Risk Factors
------------

Related dogs with hip dysplasia.

 

Diagnostic Tests
----------------

If a dog presents with pain or lameness, a veterinarian may do a
physical examination, looking for joint laxity or pain, but the
definitive diagnosis of HD in a dog with symptoms is by X-ray
(radiograph). X-rays can also detect HD prior to a dog exhibiting
symptoms. Because HD is genetic, common (11% of Samoyeds evaluated) and
very undesirable, X-rays are frequently used to screen dogs prior to
breeding.The X-rays can be sent to an organization that provides an
independent evaluation of the dog\'s hips. In the United States, the
Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) has been providing this service
for many years; they issue an OFA number if the dog has normal hips
(excellent, good or fair). PennHIP is an another well-established
organization. There are similar organizations in other countries. Each
organization evaluates x-rays, but there are differences in how the dog
is positioned for the x-rays, how they are evaluated, and at what age
the dog can be evaluated. X-ray evaluations of young dogs do not always
accurately predict whether or not a dog will develop CHD later in life.
Although HD is genetic, a DNA test is not yet available.

 

Treatment Guidelines
--------------------

Note: Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Several surgical treatments are available to treat HD, including total
hip joint replacement.Which surgery may be recommended depends on the
age of the dog, the condition of the hips, and the willingness of the
owner to accept the costs and risks. There is also a procedure, juvenile
pubic symphysiodesis, that can be performed on young puppies to prevent
the development of hip dysplasia. This is used when the risk of HD is
high, or the hip joints show laxity at a very young age. The dog is
typically spayed/neutered at the same time so that the HD is not passed
on. If surgery is not performed, anti-inflammatory medications may be
used to relieve the pain (only use canine medications prescribed by your
veterinarian; do NOT give human painkillers). Glucosamine and
chondroitin sulfate, nutritional supplements, also appear to help
although this has yet to be proven in stringent scientific studies.

Management
----------

Management techniques include ensuring the affected dog is not
overweight (to reduce stress on hips) and moderate exercise to maintain
muscle tone. HD should also be managed in a breeding program. Selecting
dogs for breeding based on x-ray screening has reduced, but not
eliminated, hip dysplasia, because some dogs can be \"carriers\" without
exhibiting HD. If only dogs with the best hips are bred (for example,
OFA excellent) , that would only be 10% of Samoyeds which would limit
the overall Samoyed gene pool too severely. The following OFA article
discusses how to use available information, including a \"vertical
pedigree,\" to help make breeding decisions.
